            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE whoſe names are here ſubſcribed, thought our ſelves more particularly, than many others, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Duty and Conſcience to appear in the front of this Book by way of approbation of the ſame; Wherein the manifold Errors of <hi>Tho. Collier,</hi> in a Book intituled [<hi>An Additional Word,</hi> &amp;c.] are clearly detected, and ſolidly enervated: Becauſe although it be a moſt unequal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make the Errours of one ſingle perſon under any Profeſſion, to reflect upon the whole of the ſame; ſeeing the Apoſtle telleth the Church in its Primitive and moſt pure ſtate, <hi>Act. 20. 30. [That there ſhould ariſe from themſelves men ſpeaking perverſe things, and draw away Diſciples after them,</hi>] yet woeful experience hath taught us that there is nothing more uſual with the world. And we did judge, that though we do not hope hereby to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the mouth of malice; yet this might be a means, to ſet us right in the thoughts of thoſe who are not byaſſed by evil affections.</p>
            <p>We had hoped that the ſnares, wherein the ſaid <hi>Tho. Collier</hi> had been many years entangled, and for which he ſeemed by Gods bleſſing on ſome of our endeavours, to manifeſt repentance, might have been a caution to him, to avoid theſe dangerous Rocks for the future; But to our grief we find it otherwiſe, and ſee that the higheſt Profeſſion cannot ſecure men from falling, when the heart is not eſtabliſhed with Grace, and kept humble before the Lord, as we ſee in the examples of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Author of this work, if any by reaſon of his inferiority in years, ſhould ſuſpect him of an over-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, ariſing from any over-weening ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:105700:3"/> caſe though of a different, yet ſomething like nature; 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 29. What have I done? is there not a cauſe?</hi> ſhall the whole Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be defied, the principles of Goſpel-truths ſubverted, the name of God blaſphemed, a flood-gate of Errour open'd, and any be thought over-forward to oppoſe the Adverſary?</p>
            <p>But over and above we think meet to acquaint thee, that the Combatant in this Conflict was not ſo much prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to it by his natural inclination, as by the joint and earneſt perſwaſion of ſeveral of the Elders, and that of elder years, partly becauſe we did judge him meet and of ability for the work, and next, at that time of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon it, a more than ordinary Providence of God, gave him leiſure for it more then others, by ſuſpending him from other more weighty employment; thereby (as it were) calling him out, and determining him to this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy: Wherein (upon our peruſal) we hope, we may truly ſay, without particular reſpect to his Perſon, he hath behaved himſelf with that modeſty of Spirit, joined with that fulneſs and clearneſs of anſwer and ſtrength of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we comfortably conceive (by Gods bleſſing) it may prove a good and ſoveraign Antidote againſt the Poiſon: from which as we earneſtly pray the venter of it may be delivered, ſo no leſs that thou alſo maiſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; And in order thereunto, deſire of thee, that thou wouldſt read this enſuing diſcourſe, with this candour and charity to believe, that it is Verity, not Victory, that is here contended for: And farther we beg of God, that thou maiſt be enabled to weigh each particular in the juſt Ballance of the Sanctuary; and that he will direct thy heart into the love of Truth, which ſhall be the daily Prayer of</p>

            <p>AMongſt all thoſe vanities which are under the Sun, this is none of the least; That ſome men puft up with a conceit of their ſufficiency for every underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, do daily burthen the world with their raw and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted notions; and whilſt they contemn that guidance they might have in the way of truth, from the labours of others who have been raiſed up and enabled of God to tranſmit to poſterity the Doctrine of the Goſpel in a form of ſound words, do darken counſel by words without knowledge: But alas! Our ſorrow on this account may be drowned in Tears for a greater evil, if we reflect on the more bold and dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of ſome, who are not ſatisfied to have darkened the ſhining luſtre of divine truth, unleſs they do alſo ſubvert the foundations of the Chriſtian Religion, by a downright oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſome of the moſt important Doctrines thereof. And one ſad inſtance of this kind we have in a Book not long ſince publiſhed by <hi>Thomas Collier,</hi> which he calls <hi>An Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Word,</hi> &amp;c. which hath occaſioned my writing this ſmall Treatiſe in anſwer thereto; For although the argument of the Book may not ſeem to require his pains; inaſmuch as there is nothing urged by him to give countenance to his corrupt notions, but it hath either been anſwered many times already by thoſe that have written againſt the <hi>Pelagians, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> in whoſe ſteps Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently treads; or elſe (where he doth tranſcend the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of thoſe mentioned) its weakneſs and impiety is more manifeſt then to need any refutation by another; yet on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accounts, ſome Anſwer to him was judged neceſsary, not
<pb facs="tcp:105700:4"/> only by my ſelf, but by divers others, whoſe Judgement in this matter I eſteemed much more then my own; That ſo (at leaſt) a Publick teſtimony might be born againſt thoſe groſs Errors therein, by him expos'd to publick view; and by the detection of them, the intanglement and ſeduction of weak (though well-meaning) Souls might be prevented, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were in danger to be drawn away by him, to drink in thoſe notions that will eat as doth a Canker; and alſo that perſons irreligious and ungodly, who are ready to catch at any thing, even againſt the Judgement of their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that may give them quiet in their ſinful ways, might not reſt in peace on thoſe Pillows he hath prepared for them; by his endeavour to perſwade them, That there is no ſuch Eternal wrath and Judgement like to overtake them, as that which they have been warned to flee from by thoſe that know the terrour of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Theſe with ſome other things of like import, prevailed with me to account it neceſſary, That thoſe precious truths oppoſed by him, ſhould be vindicated from his cavils and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: though for my ſelf, I can truly ſay, I had much rather for many reaſons, ſome other of my Brethren had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken this work; and I have many witneſſes this task was impoſed on, not ſought by me; for I have no ſuch eſteem of my ability, as to deſire to trouble the world in Print; and therefore I beg a candid interpretation of my appearing in publick on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>In my anſwer I have been forced very briefly to touch upon many of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notions, being deſirous to bring it into as little room as might be, leſt by its length it ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the leſs ſerviceable to many of thoſe for whoſe good it was chiefly intended; and therefore have paſſed over many things more remote from the main controverſie, in ſilence, which otherwiſe might have deſerved ſome remark: Amongſt which you may reckon that which ſo often occurs in his Book, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105700:4"/> This and that is true in a <hi>Goſpel ſenſe,</hi> or <hi>ſome Scripture ſenſe;</hi> which ſenſe he yet gives us no account of, but what we muſt gather from his accommodation of that which he ſaith is true in a Goſpel ſenſe, to his own abſurd Opinions, which may ſerve to amuſe and deceive his ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Reader.</p>
            <p>This I am abundantly ſatisfied in, That what I have aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is plainly confirmed in the Scripture of truth, and agreeable to that Doctrine which the Church of God hath always been poſſeſſed of; and are no new notions of my own coyning; and therefore I hope by the Grace of Chriſt to be enabled farther to clear and ſtrengthen what I have written, if occaſion be really offered by Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a reply as hath any colour of reaſon urged againſt it; otherwiſe I ſhall not concern my ſelf with a noiſe of vain words, but reſt ſatisfyed in that I have once for all born my witneſs againſt him, and detected his Errors.</p>
            <p>I earneſtly deſire that God would give him Repentance unto the acknowledgement of the truth, that by his own recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he hath publiſhed ſo contrary thereto, and offenſive to true Chriſtians, this conteſt may have an end put to it; And foraſmuch as I underſtand Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> pretends ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Labours of Dr. <hi>Uſher;</hi> I could heartily wiſh he would ſeriouſly read over his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> and his Treatiſe of <hi>the Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> printed at the end thereof; that if he will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what I have written, yet he may by that holy man be better informed about the principles of Chriſtianity. And that he may for the future eſcape that abſurdity and confuſion he hath caſt himſelf into in his firſt Ch. concerning the Perſon of Chriſt, I deſire he would compare this obſervation of the Dr. with what I have written on the ſame head, to the ſame purpoſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By reaſon of the ſtrictneſs of the perſonal Union, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:105700:5"/> may be verified of either of thoſe natures (the Divine or Humane) the ſame may be truly ſpoken of the whole Perſon, from whetherſoever of the natures it be denominated.</hi> And let him take in the other parts of that diſcourſe with it, wherein he ſolidly proves that the Son of God took the nature of man (not an humane perſon) into a perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with himſelf, and ſo was manifeſt in fleſh, and wrought out our Redemption; as alſo his pithy and pious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this ſubject in his <hi>Body of Divinity, p. 164, 165.</hi> &amp;c. and it may prove of ſingular uſe to guide him out of that labyrinth of Errour he is at preſent loſt in, if more groſs tenets do not lye in the bottom of his diſcourſes, then he is yet willing to ſpeak out plainly before the world; which I would not ſuggeſt my ſuſpicion of, did I not diſcern ground for it in what he hath already written, eſpecially if compared with the Hereſies formerly eſpouſed by him; but being willing to wait for his more plain and ingenuous opening of his own ſenſe; I have for the preſent paſſed over many things, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his firſt Ch. that are of an harſh ſound in Chriſtian ears, though clouded in ambiguous terms; expecting that his Rejoynder will either give me occaſion to put a better ſenſe upon thoſe phraſes, then the words at preſent ſeem well to bear, or elſe engage me to a farther detection of his abomination couched in them.</p>
            <p>With the latter part of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Book, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles, <hi>An healing word,</hi> I have not concerned my ſelf, though divers things therein are lyable to juſt exception; but I must tell him, There can be no <hi>Goſpel Peace</hi> without <hi>truth,</hi> nor Communion of Saints, without an agreement in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of the Christian Religion. We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints; and mark thoſe that cauſe diviſions among us by their new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contrary thereto, and avoid them; And lest any ſhould be deceived by Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> good words and fair
<pb facs="tcp:105700:5"/> ſpeeches, I cannot but take notice that his <hi>General Epiſtles</hi> were uſhered into the world, with the ſame pretext of <hi>making peace,</hi> and <hi>diſcharge of his Conſcience,</hi> and with as great ſhew of <hi>zeal for God,</hi> and other as <hi>plauſible pretences,</hi> as any he now maketh or can make; And yet one ſhall hardly find more contradictory and blaſphemous notions, in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of any called, or pretending to be Christians, then in them: For, beſides his contempt of the holy Scriptures and all Ordinances; there he tells us; <hi>To have Communion and Fellowſhip with the Father, is to be one in Common with God; to have fellowſhip, is to be Gods fellow; ſo is Chriſt, ſo are Saints,</hi> p. 243. <hi>Chriſt is no more then a Chriſtian,</hi> p. 244. with other like blaſphemies, which I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the recital of. Theſe things indeed (as I am informed) he ſaith he hath repented of; but never yet thought himſelf obliged to publiſh to the world an ingenuous recantation of them; that ſo thoſe concerned might have from himſelf a plain and particular warning to take heed of that poiſon which hath flowed from his own pen: however, it may be a good warning to us not to heed the ſmooth, or ſwelling words of a man carried about with every wind of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I have but a word or two more, and that is, to acquaint thee that I have been troubled for the delays that this little work hath met with, both before and ſince it went to the Preſs, which yet I could not help; I have taken what care I could that <hi>Errata's</hi> in Printing it might be prevented, and deſire that thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

            <argument>
               <p>Concerning God; The diſtinct Subſiſtencies in the Divine Nature: And more eſpecially, the Perſon of the Son.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MR. <hi>Collier</hi> intimates in the beginning of his firſt Chapter, That he had been from ſome private hand admoniſhed of certain errors by him before publiſhed in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> which in this Chapter he endeavours to vindicate; and makes this the occaſion of the putting forth the whole of what we find in his <hi>Additional Word:</hi> But verily this courſe is in no wiſe like to give ſatisfaction to them who before were juſtly offended: For a man when he is blamed for ſwerving from the form of ſound words, and that Doctrine that is according to Godlineſs in ſome inſtances; to repeat his errors with new Confidence, inſtead of a retractation of them; and then to add many more, and more dangerous againſt the analogy of Faith, yea the expreſs words of Scripture, and common ſentiments of all that deſerve the name of Chriſtians, is not the way to reconcile himſelf to the truth, or to any true lovers thereof: <hi>And that Mr.</hi> Collier <hi>hath thus done, will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in our progreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are plentifully inſtructed from the Scripture, That there is but one only living and true God, who is a moſt pure Spirit, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Immutable, Incomprehenſible, and infinitely perfect in his Being, and all the properties thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> profeſſeth to own; yet he hath in the cloſe of this firſt Chapter of his <hi>Additional Word,</hi> dropt an expreſſion or two that ſeem to hold no very full harmony therewith: He ſaith, p. 12. <hi>As to the Omnipreſence of God the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, which directeth us to the Father as in Heaven; and that by his Spirit he is preſent in all places.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105700:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Omnipreſence is an Eſſential property of God, grounded on his Infiniteneſs; it is as neceſſary to him to be Omnip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ent, as to be God. It is all one therefore whether we ſpeak of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of the Father, or of the Son, or of the holy Spirit, theſe three being that One incomprehenſible and infinite <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to whom all fear and worſhip is due: And to deny it of any of them, is to deny their Divinity. And whereas Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> tells us, <hi>That he ſaith what the Scripture ſaith, &amp;c.</hi> That is not enough, unleſs he make it manifeſt alſo, That he ſaith it according to the true ſenſe and intendment of the Spirit of God in thoſe Scriptures he refers unto. I am unwilling to entertain jealouſies of any man; but yet I muſt ſay, That thoſe <hi>Socinians</hi> who have moſt oppoſed the truth concerning the immenſity of God, have yet ſaid as much as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> here preſents us with; and to clear himſelf from ſuſpicion in this matter when queſtioned about it, more might juſtly have been expected from him. The Scriptures indeed ſpeak of God as in Heaven, but that is (as many other expreſſions in them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re) in a way of condeſcenſion to our capacity. And we muſt always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that thoſe things that are ſpoken of God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> after the manner of men, muſt be interpreted <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in a ſenſe becoming God; elſe we muſt immediately cloſe with, the groſs and abſurd Hereſie of the <hi>Authropomorphites.</hi> Seeing then that we conceive of no place ſo glorious as Heaven, that is repreſented to us as the dwelling place, or Throne of the moſt high, that ſo we might be affected with his Glorious Majeſty; Heaven alſo is the place where God doth manifeſt his Glory in a more eminent way then in any other part of the Creation: On theſe accounts, or ſome other like unto them, he is ſaid to be in Heaven, but leaſt we ſhould conceive of him as confined to any place, or limited in his being, we are expreſly told in his word: <hi>The Lord your God, he is God in Heaven above, and in Earth beneath,</hi> Joſh. 2. 11. And again, <hi>Behold the Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee,</hi> 1 Kings 8. 27. <hi>Am I a God at hand ſaith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord? Jer.</hi> 23, 24. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. and divers expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons of the ſame import we meet with therein, in other places. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f then the Spirit of God be preſent in all places, the Father is ſo, and the Son is ſo, for the Divine Eſſence is undivided; and as I ſaid at firſt, This is an Eſſential property of God that we are ſpeaking
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105700:8"/> of. I might here ſtay to tell him in what a corrupt and impious ſenſe ſome have uſed the expreſſions he here makes uſe of; but I ſhall proceed no farther with this point at preſent; If he declare himſelf to embrace the truth, this ſufficeth; if he farther declare his mind in oppoſition thereto, we ſhall then have a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to in large on this head.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page he doth re-aſſert and endeavour to inforce his notion of the <hi>increated Heavens.</hi> But notwithſtanding what he ſaith. I cannot ſee how this notion may be reconciled, either with the Scripture, or right Reaſon: Himſelf confeſſeth, that Eternity is an attribute proper to God alone, and certainly to be increated is no leſs ſo: Creator and creature do divide all beings; how then can we conceive of any increated being but God himſelf, or of any thing that is abſolutely Eternal beſides himſelf? Again, if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to conceive of an Eternal and increated habitation for God; I ask him whether we may imagine any ſpace without thoſe Heavens: if not? Then is the whole World within that increated and eternal dwelling place; which will hardly ſuit with Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> opinion of it. If we may imagine ſpace without thoſe Heavens, then I ask whether we are to conceive of God in thoſe Heavens, and not in that ſpace; if he anſwer we are, then doth he indeed oppoſe the immenſity and incomprehenſibility of the holy one of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> If he ſay we are not to imagine him limited by theſe Heavens; Then muſt he grant alſo, That he is Everlaſtingly and Eſſentially preſent, as well in the infinite ſpace without them, as within them, for he is immutable; how then is the one his dwelling place more then the other? If Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> remove theſe, his notion may eaſily be clogg'd with other doubts: But we will conſider what he offers for the proof thereof. Thus he pleads, p 12. §. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the increated Heavens, though in the term of Increated it be not expreſt, yet there is enough in Scripture to prove the truth thereof; For the Eternal God muſt have ſome Eternal habitation, as it is called</hi> Iſa. 57. 15. <hi>The high and holy place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> own aſſertion (p. 2. of his <hi>Additional word</hi>) if he affirm that concerning the increated Heavens, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do not, it muſt needs be unſound and unſafe: He confeſſeth that in the term of increated they are not to be found in Scripture, but yet both here, and in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> p. 46, 47. he hath diſcovered the moſt Glorious Heaven, ſuch as the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> or the <hi>Pſalms</hi> make no mention of; for the Heavens, and the Heaven
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105700:9"/> of Heavens mentioned therein, he affirms are polluted by the ſin of Man.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> doth intimate to his Reader, as if the Glory of the Eternal God was not exalted above theſe moſt glorious Heavens; and that the moſt high God doth not humble himſelf when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them. As for the Heavens which were known to the Pſalmiſt, and of which he ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal. 8. 1. Pſal.</hi> 1. 3. 4, 5, 6. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> acknowledgeth Gods glory to be ſet above all them, and that when he beholds them, he humbles himſelf; and hereof he gives you a double reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> not only becauſe he created them, (which is true) but alſo becauſe as he affirms the created Heavens are all in a fallen eſtate, together with the Earth, by reaſon of the ſin of man: And therefore in his <hi>Additional Word,</hi> p. 12. §. 5. He endeavours to prove the corruption of the Heavens by the ſin of man, from <hi>Job 15. 15. The Heavens are not clean in thy ſight:</hi> But I conceive the ſcope of that Text is by way of compariſon, to ſhew how vile man is, inaſmuch as the pureſt part of the Creation, even the Heavens, <hi>in conſpectu Dei,</hi> or compared with the moſt holy pure God, are not to be reputed pure, rather then to impute to the Heavens any ſinful defilement. So that here again we have another taſt of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> unſcriptural boldneſs: whence doth he collect that the ſin of Man reached ſo high as to corrupt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens? one would think, if there be any ſuch corruption, it ſhould rather be referred to the ſin of Angels, who were once Inhabitants therein, then to the ſin of Man.</p>
            <p>But to come to a more ſtrict examination of his notion, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſuppoſed increated Heavens; which I take to be not only unſcriptural, but antiſcriptural; and his proof by his <hi>oportet</hi> it muſt be ſo, to be moſt abſurd and irrational.</p>
            <p>The only Text he quotes, upon which he would faſten his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt notion, is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 13. of which he takes only a part of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and omits the reſt; The Text ſpeaks thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For thus ſaith the high and holy one, that inhabiteth Eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the habitation of the high and holy God is in general terms ſaid to be in Eternity, without reference to any place whatſoever; Then he comes to diſtinguiſh of his preſent reſidence, and that is ſaid to be, not only in the high and holy place, (take it for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105700:9"/> but withall, in the heart of every one of his humble and contrite Saints: Heaven, and the heart of a Believer, may be alike truly ſaid, to be the habitation of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 21, 22. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens is not comprehenſive of the immenſe God: yet no Believers heart is too narrow for an habitation for him: And as the Text doth expreſs the high and holy place, and a contrite ſpirit on Earth, to be at the ſame inſtant Gods dwelling place; ſo is it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſilent as to this high and holy place, being increated.</p>
            <p>But to manifeſt that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſpeaks not only without the Scriptures, but againſt the Scriptures herein, let theſe Texts be conſidered: <hi>Thus the Heavens were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them,</hi> Gen. 2. 1. <hi>He commanded, and the Heaven of Heavens were created,</hi> Pſal. 48. 4, 5. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſts of them,</hi> Pſal. 33. 6. what the Hoſts of Heaven are, you may underſtand by 2 <hi>Chron. 18. 18. Luke</hi> 2. 13. And if theſe Hoſts of Heaven, the holy Angels, do always behold the face of God: and all of them both place and Inhabitants, were part of the ſix days creation; as <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 11. And if the face of God be beheld, where his glory is diſplayed in the greateſt ſplendour, then certainly there is no colour, nor place left for any increated Heavens.</p>
            <p>And why cannot Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> conceive of the Eternal God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Eternal Habitation diſtinct from himſelf? If he muſt have ſuch an habitation, it is either becauſe his happineſs would not be perfect without it, which is to make him dependant on ſomething beſide himſelf, and to deny his Godhead, by denying his ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency: or elſe it muſt be, becauſe his being is ſuch, as is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and limited by certain bounds: as Bodies are properly ſaid to be in ſuch or ſuch a place; becauſe they are circumſcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome ſpace that they fill up: Created ſpirits, (though in a more improper ſenſe) yet are truly ſaid to be in a place; becauſe, though they have not parts and dimenſions as bodies have, ſo filling up the place where they are, nor can be punctually circumſcribed as they may; yet they are ſo in ſome certain place, as not to be at the ſame time without it, or elſewhere. Now therefore when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the being of either of theſe, we muſt alſo conceive of ſome ſpace ſuſceptive of them, which we call <hi>place;</hi> becauſe they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: But what place can we conceive of for his dwelling therein, who is immenſe, and indiſtant to all places and things, preſent to all by and in his infinite eſſence and being, but contained in none. He adds,</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105700:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>If God hath prepared a Building, a Houſe (for his people) not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. <hi>Methinks it ſhould be no crime to ſay, that he hath an Eternal habitation for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſuitable to his name and nature, and if Eternal then Increated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the ambiguity of the word <hi>Eternal,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> meets with in the Text, is the occaſion of his miſtake in part; If we look into the Scriptures, we ſhall find mention made of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold duration; 1. That which is abſolutely Eterna, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end; and this is proper to God alone. 2. That which hath a beginning but ſhall have no end, which for diſtinction ſake is commonly called Aeviternity. And 3. That which hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſhall have an end, which is time. Now the term <hi>Eternal</hi> is indifferently uſed in the Scripture to ſignifie either of the two former; but this ambiguity is eaſily removed, if we conſider the ſubject ſpoken of; when it is applyed to God, we muſt take it in the firſt ſenſe; but when unto Creatures, in the ſecond: ſo then the Apoſtle, as is clear from the ſcope of the Text, when he ſpeaks of an Houſe Eternal in the Heavens, doth not intend a building that had been from Everlaſting, but ſuch an one as notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding its Creation (for it was made, though without hands, by the power of God) in time, ſhould not decay as the earthly houſe of our Tabernacle doth, but abide incorruptible for ever. And let not Mr. <hi>C.</hi> think, that becauſe we need a houſe, a building in the Heavens to compleat our happineſs; that therefore the former of all things doth ſo. So then this Text will not bear the weight he lays on it: And when in the cloſe he infers from the Eternity of Gods dwelling place, that it is alſo <hi>increated,</hi> he might have added, <hi>and then God;</hi> for this neceſſarily follows upon the grant of the other: and by this very medium Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> p. 85. proves, that Angels are created beings: His words are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon teacheth that they muſt be and are created, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> elſe they muſt be Eternal, which is proper to none but God; and if ſo they muſt be God; but they are not God,</hi> &amp;c. and by that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> may ſee that he hath intangled himſelf in medling with things that he underſtands not. But I ſhall proceed;</p>
            <p>The Scripture doth alſo inſtruct us concerning the ſubſiſtence of God, or the manner of his being; and this is ſuch a glorious my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery as by his word only is revealed to us; We cannot by reaſon comprehend it, but ought to adore it; and by Faith reſt in his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony concerning it.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105700:10"/>
            <p>In 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. we are taught, that there are three that do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Divine eſſence; and that theſe three are the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, who are the one true God. Here then is ſet before us the Divine eſſence, ſubſiſting in three relative properties: The relative property of the Father is to beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, <hi>Pſ. 2. 7. Joh.</hi> 3. 16. The relative property of the Son is to be begotten; The relative properly of the Holy Spirit is <hi>to be breathed,</hi> or to <hi>proceed</hi> from the Father and the Son, <hi>Joh. 15. 26. Rom.</hi> 8. 9, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now unto theſe relative properties belong all imaginable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; but no imperfection, becauſe they are in God: Therefore as conſidered in him they do inferr perſonality, becauſe a perſonal ſubſiſtence, is the moſt perfect manner of being in the whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature: And throughout the Scriptures when the Father, Son or Holy Ghoſt are diſtinctly ſpoken of, thoſe terms are made uſe of that are proper only unto a perſon; and perſonal operations are every where aſcribed to them; Though in our conception of perſonality in the Divine nature, we muſt ſeparate from it whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imperfection is ſeen in a created perſon: Every created perſon hath a limited eſſence diſtinct and diſtant one from another: But all the increated perſons in the Deity have the ſame immenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided eſſence, and are the one Eternal immortal inviſible only wiſe God. In created perſons alſo there is difference of time in the proceeding of one from the other; but here though there be an Eternal order of origination, there is no priority of time or nature. Add hereunto the warranty of this term from <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. 3. where it is applied to the Father, (and there is the ſame reaſon for our uſing it, when we ſpeak of the Son or Spirit) and I cannot ſee why Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſhould reject or except againſt it as he doth, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12. and in his <hi>Bod. of Div.</hi> However I ſhall not ſtrive about words, if the thing be owned: But it is commonly ſeen, that men have been offended with apt terms, becauſe the things expreſſed by them have been diſpleaſing to them. But I ſhall paſs this alſo, and return to the beginning of his Chapter, that his ſtrange notions about the perſon of the Son of God may be brought to examination.</p>
            <p>And that I may proceed with the more clearneſs, I will firſt briefly repreſent what the Scripture teacheth in this matter.</p>
            <p>That the Son of God might become the author of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto loſt ſinners, he took upon him the office of a Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and them; and in order to the accompliſhment of what he had undertaken on their behalf, it was neceſſary that he ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105700:11"/> take hold of their nature, and be manifeſted in fleſh. In the perſon of Chriſt therefore we are to mind,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The diſtinction of both natures, Divine and Humane.</item>
               <item>2. The union of both natures in the perſon of the Mediator.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, Both the Divine and Humane nature in Chriſt remain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in their eſſence, and all their eſſential properties, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily muſt do ſo, the one being created, and the other increated; the Divine nature cannot be changed into the Humane, nor the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane into the Divine; neither is it poſſible that they ſhould be ſo confounded or mixed together, as to make a third nature diſtinct from both. <hi>The Word was God, and the Word was made fleſh, Joh. 1. He was in the form of God, and yet took upon him the form of a ſervant, Phil.</hi> 2. He was and remained the only begotten of the Father, his own Son, and yet was in all things made like to us, ſin only excepted. He was true God: God by nature, and true man alſo, made of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> as concerning the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a glorious and unſpeakable union of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the perſon of Chriſt: As he is Immanuel he is but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as ſuch is ſpoken of throughout the Scripture; even the ſame perſon that in the beginning was with God. The Humane nature of Chriſt never having a perſonality of its own,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i Medullam.</hi>
               </note> did from the firſt moment of its being ſubſiſt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son of God. So then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Though the ſecond perſon of the Deity have but one only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, yet his ſubſiſtence is to be conſidered with a twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; firſt, as he was in the Divine nature from Eternity; and alſo as he was manifeſt in the fleſh; which laſt inferrs no change in God, but only a relation: The Son of God remained what he was; although he became what he was not, by uniting the Humane nature with the Divine in one perſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though there is not, nor cannot be a real transfuſion of the properties of the Divine nature into the Humane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane into the Divine, yet by reaſon of this ſtrict union of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is a perſonal communication of properties, which doth conſiſt in a communion or concurrence of both natures unto the ſame operations, ſo as they are done by both natures together, yet each nature worketh according to its own properties: So that all that Chriſt did or ſuffered, is properly referred to his perſon: but if we conſider the immediate principle of his actions, ſome
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105700:11"/> of them muſt be referred to his Divine nature only, others to his Humane.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence ariſeth, and herein is founded, that communication of properties in the Scriptures ſpeaking of Chriſt; 1. When that is ſpoken of the Perſon that agreeth to him onely with reſpect to one of his natures; as when Chriſt is ſaid to dye, of which he was capable only in his Humane nature, or to create all things which was proper to his Divine nature. And ſometimes it is ſaid of him, <hi>that he knew what was in man, that he ſearcheth the reins,</hi> &amp;c. at another time, <hi>that he knew not the day of Judgement:</hi> So likewiſe of God it is true, that he cannot be tempted of evil; and yet Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was God as well as man, ſuffered being tempted; but then this could not be as God, but as man, conſidered as made like to his Brethren in all things, except ſin: neither can we avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, without embracing this way of expoſition, which is alone ſuited to the mind of the Spirit of God in ſuch ſayings; and founded in the real diſtinction of both natures, without diviſion in the perſon of Chriſt. 2. Sometimes alſo that is attributed to one nature (as it doth connote the perſon) that is proper to the other, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. That is ſpoken of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſhedding his blood, and laying down his life; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without blaſphemy be affirmed of the Divine nature as ſuch. 3. And again, That which is only proper to the perſon as ſuch, conſidered in both natures, is attributed to the one nature; as 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>There is one Mediator betwixt God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He was not Mediator as man only, nor as God only, but as God-man in one perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe things well weighed, may deliver us from that ſtrange confuſion that Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> diſcourſe tends to caſt us into, and might ſerve for a refutation of his firſt Chapter: but for the help of the weak (for whoſe ſake this work was undertaken) I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly examine whatever therein might be occaſion of ſtumbling to them, and remove it out of the way.</p>
            <p>In p. 1. of his Book he thus writes,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The exceptions againſt what I ſaid in this matter</hi> (i. e. <hi>relating to the Perſon of the Son of God) are as followeth,</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he is not the Son of God in the Divine nature only.</item>
               <item>2. That he is the Son of God only as conſidered in both natures.</item>
               <item>3. That he was the word as he was God-man and man-God.</item>
               <item>4. That as God-man he was a Creature.</item>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105700:12"/>
               <item>5. That this Creature God and man created all things.</item>
               <item>6. That this Word God-man was made fleſh.</item>
               <item>7. That he is the Son of Man in both natures.</item>
            </list>
            <p>By theſe words of his one would conclude theſe groſs contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were the aſſertions of the animadverter on his Book; but his meaning is, That theſe are the things excepted againſt in it, which he ſtill owns, and undertakes the vindication of them, in which fruitleſs attempt I ſhall attend him; He begins with the firſt; <hi>That he is not the Son of God in the Divine nature only. My reaſon for this is, Becauſe the Scripture no where (that I know) affirms him ſo to be, and for me or any other to affirm, that which the Scripture doth not, muſt needs be unſound and unſafe: The Scripture always when it ſpeaks of the Son of God, it is as he was in both natures, God and Man; and hence its ſafe to ſay, that he was not the Son of God in the Divine nature only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had I met with this poſition concerning Chriſt by it ſelf, <hi>That he is not the Son of God in the Divine nature only,</hi> charity would have moved me to hope, that the deſign thereof (though the words are harſh and improper) had been no more then to aſſert the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble union of the humane nature with the Divine, in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſince the incarnation of the Son of God. But his defence thereof, together with his following poſitions, will in no wiſe admit this ſenſe, but determine his meaning to be, <hi>That Chriſt is no otherwiſe (nor ever was) the Son of God, but as he was God-man, conſidered in both natures.</hi> Whence it neceſſarily followeth, That either he had no exiſtence before the days of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> when he was born of the Virgin; or elſe that he had both natures, and was a man, before he came of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> as concerning the fleſh: And this laſt abſurdity he ſeems not to ſtick at in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines. The argument he endeavours to confirm his notion by, may be thus framed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which the Scripture no where affirms, is unſound and unſafe for any man to affirm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Scripture no where affirms Chriſt to be the Son of God in the Divine nature-only.</hi> Ergo,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For any man to affirm it is unſound and unſafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If his meaning in his firſt propoſition be, that every notion that is not either expreſt in terms in the Scripture, or by juſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deduced from it (for <hi>ex veris nil niſi verum</hi>) is unſound, we grant it; But then his aſſumption is falſe, and muſt be denied:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105700:12"/> All the inforcement he gives it is in theſe words, <hi>The Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when it ſpeaks of the Son of God, it is as he was in both natures God and Man.</hi> But I ſhall prove the contrary by an inſtance or two (out of thoſe many that might be produced) from the Scripture.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Pſal. 33. 6. By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made.</hi> This text I do the rather mention, becauſe Mr. C. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, p. 2. That it is the Son of God that is here ſpoken of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of the Word: And it is evident, that he is nor here ſpoken of as he was God-man; but only as he did ſubſiſt in the form of God: The deſign of the Pſalmiſt being to ſet forth the Glory of his Eternal Power and God-head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by enumerating ſome of his great works, in this and the following Verſes. As he is the Creator of all things is his praiſe here celebrated, long before he became <hi>Immanuel</hi> by taking our nature.</p>
            <p>The next Scripture I urge for the proof of Chriſts being ſpoken of as the Son of God before his Incarnation, is <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. from <hi>v.</hi> 22. to the end of the Chapter. Which Text hath always been a grievous eye-ſore to the enemies of the Son of God; and hath by the Orthodox been pleaded with great advantage, both againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> The laſt mentioned have laid in all the Cavils they could deviſe, to perſwade men that it is not the Son of God that is here intended; and with them Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> joyns, and puts in his exceptions alſo againſt the application of it to him, p. 7. The learned know where and by whom this Text with others, have been fully vindicated from their exceptions; And amongſt others Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Exercitations prefixed to the ſecond part of his Expoſition of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> p. 37. &amp;c. hath ſo learnedly and ſolidly aſſerted the truth by me pleaded for, from this Text; with ſo full an anſwer to all <hi>Socinian</hi> cavils againſt it, as leaves no ground for Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> ſaying, <hi>That it is a queſtion too hard for any man to reſolve, whether this Scripture intend the Son of God or not.</hi> His fond trifling in the expoſition of it, I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with, but only remove his exceptions laid in againſt the true ſenſe of it; which being eſtabliſhed, his gloſs upon it vaniſheth without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble.</p>
            <p>That an <hi>intelligent perſon</hi> is intended in this Text, almoſt every Verſe in the Chapter doth confirm, for all kind of perſonal proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are aſcribed to it; and if we compare this with <hi>chap. 1. 21. ad finem;</hi> we muſt acknowledge, That Wiſdom ſpeaking in them, is a perſon, and a Divine perſon too, unto whom all fear and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> adds, If it be not ſo,—<hi>he could not be ſet up from Everlaſting;</hi> This doth not at all weaken, but enforce what I have pleaded: Divers able inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, <hi>viz.

The Son is Lord of the whole Creation, and Heir of all things; and this right of principality in him hath a double
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105700:15"/> foundation; 1. It is in him as he is the Son begotten of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Father, having the ſame Eſſence with him, and the Creator of all things. 2. It is founded in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption made between the Father and him, and is referred to his Mediatory kingdom; The firſt belongs to him by neceſſity of nature from Everlaſting, unto his Mediatory kingdom and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality he was deſigned of God according to Covenant, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained from Everlaſting. There is then nothing in theſe words that will give Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> any relief; what he further adds, requires no anſwer: So then here is a ſecond witneſs to the Everlaſting Son-ſhip of Chriſt, before he was God-man.</p>
            <p>I will mention one Text more, where we have not only the thing, but even the term plainly expreſt, <hi>Prov. 30. 4.—Who hath eſtabliſhed all the ends of the Earth? what is his name, or what is his Sons name, if thou canſt tell?</hi> This Scripture fully holds forth, That the Father had a Son before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt, whoſe name was Wonderful, and his Glory as unſpeakable as that of the Father; It is therefore the Son of God, <hi>not as made fleſh,</hi> but as he was from Eternity with God, having his Eſſence and Glory that is here mentioned.</p>
            <p>But why do I ſtay to enumerate particular teſtimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es? ſeeing all thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of his Divine nature do confirm the truth pleaded for, <hi>Joh. 1. The word was God, and the word was made fleſh;</hi> How and when he was made fleſh, the other Evangeliſts par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly relate: But before that, This word was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with God, and he is acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> to be the ſecond in the Trinity, and that his title is the Son. And indeed the being of the Divine Eſſence is not more neceſſary, then the manner of its being, <hi>i. e.</hi> the incommunicable relative properties thereof, or the ſubſiſting of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit therein.</p>
            <p>I conclude therefore, that it is not only ſafe and ſound to aſſert, but moreover that it always was an Article of the Common faith of Chriſtians; That the Son of God <hi>was,</hi> before he was made fleſh, while he ſubſiſted only in the form of God; And to deny that he was the Son of God in the Divine nature only, is by juſt conſequence to deny that he hath a Divine nature, ſeeing it either infers an utter denial of his pre-exiſtence to his Incarnation, or at leaſt, that the nature he had before, was neither Perſon nor Son, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it received its perfection, and became both by the uniting of the Humane nature thereto.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:105700:15"/>
            <p>By Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> after-diſcourſe it appears, that he hath been caſt upon thoſe abſurd contradictions that this Chapter is filled with, by a very groſs miſtake of the Decree of God concerning Chriſt, and the Prophecies of his coming in the fleſh: Becauſe it was from Eternity decreed that the Son of God ſhould become <hi>Immanuel,</hi> he concludes, that he is to be conſidered as being actually God-man from Everlaſting: and becauſe it was foretold what he ſhould be, therefore he always was ſuch an one. But he may as well conclude, That himſelf, or any other thing that ever was, is, or ſhall be in nature, had an Everlaſting exiſtence, ſeeing the futurition of all theſe, was from Everlaſting determined in Gods Decree.</p>
            <p>Having thus removed the foundation of his whole diſcourſe on this ſubject, I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a reply to every futilous cavil and contradiction I meet with in the remaining part of this Chapter, but paſs through it with all ſpeed and brevity.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to the ſecond poſition, which depends on the firſt, <hi>viz. That he is the Son of God only as conſidered in both natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His reaſon for this is the ſame alſo in effect with his former, and his whole plea in defence of it, is already ſufficiently enervated: But becauſe he here endeavours to wreſt many Texts, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his notion, I will in few words reply to his abuſe of them. The firſt is <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 14. Let that whole context be ſoberly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and we need no more to reprove Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> folly. But he ſaith, <hi>The Scriptures that ſpeak of Chriſt as in the boſom of the Father before time, ſpeak of him</hi> as he <hi>came forth in time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Son of God, as to his Divine nature, <hi>is the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to day, and for ever,</hi> is certain; and that the Godhead of Chriſt underwent no change when he was made fleſh, is before proved; But that he took not into a perſonal Union with himſelf a nature he had not before, when he was made fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh, is falſe and abſurd; and directly oppoſeth the very terms of the Text produced by him.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is too evident that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> doth not underſtand the force of the particle <hi>as,</hi> which he ſo frequently uſeth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuppoſeth, that whatſoever is ſpoken of the Perſon that was God-man, is indifferently ſpoken of either nature as ſuch in that Perſon. Whereas (although the Body and Soul of man do make up but one Humane nature) in ordinary diſcourſe we hear thoſe things attributed to that Perſon who is both animal and rational, of which ſome belong to him only as he is animal, <hi>viz.</hi> to eat,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105700:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> drink, ſleep, dye; others only as he is rational, <hi>viz.</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, deliberate, will, &amp;c. It is to be bewailed that a man which ſtumbles at ſuch things as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next Scripture inſiſted on by him is <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 29. unto which we may add <hi>Eph. 1. 4. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> reaſonings from theſe Scriptures is to this purpoſe,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Therefore as God man he was with the Father before time, and as ſuch only is his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that God did never intend the ſalvation of any ſinners but in and by Chriſt, and when God did before time chooſe a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in him, he had a reſpect to his Incarnation, and redeeming of them according to the terms of the Covenant between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Chriſt: They were choſen then in Chriſt conſidered as one that had undertaken to be a Mediator betwixt God and men, and in order to the accompliſhing of what he ſo undertook, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time to become <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or <hi>anointed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So likewiſe to conceit that he was <hi>actually God-man,</hi> when we were choſen in him, as Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> doth, can ariſe from no other ground, but his confounding the Decree of God with the execution thereof. And let but the Reader compare <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. referr'd to by him with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. with which he cloſeth this Section, and he will need no other antidote againſt Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Doctrine.</p>

I know Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſcornfully rejects what I inſiſt on, in his <hi>8th.</hi> page: But offers no reaſon for his ſo doing; and the contradiction, yea blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy that he runs upon in refuſing that truth, may warn us to give the more heed thereto. Thus he writes p. 4. §. 5. <hi>And as he was the Prince of life,</hi> Act. 3. 15. <hi>the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8. <hi>was he killed and crucified, and certainly that was not in the Humane nature only; for ſo he could not be the Prince of Life and Lord of Glory.</hi> I wiſh Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> had ſeriouſly thought of that ſaying Prov. 30. 6. <hi>Add thou not unto his words leaſt he reproove thee, and thou be found a lyar:</hi> In the Scriptures cited by him there is no ſuch thing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>that as he was the Prince of Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he was killed and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> They ſay indeed, That the Prince of Life was killed, and the Lord of Glory was Crucified: So the Scripture ſaith alſo, that God purchaſed his Church by his blood; and laid down his Life for us: The perſon that died was very God, the Prince of Life and Lord of Glory, but it was in his Humane nature, and not in his Divine that he ſuffered, although both made but one perſon; and to reject this, and ſay with Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> that as God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Bloud was ſhed, he was crucified and died, <hi>i. e.</hi> that all theſe things befell the Divine as well as the Humane nature; is impious to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as may make a tender heart bleed, and the ears of a godly man to tingle. He ſaith in the ſame Section,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That unſcriptural notion doth not reach the caſe, that the Humane
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105700:17"/> nature ſuffered, and the Divine nature ſatisfied; it is the ſame who ſuffered, that ſatisfied.</hi> The common faith of Chriſtians about this matter is, That the ſame Jeſus who ſuffered made ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice for their ſins; but that his ſufferings were in his Humane nature only, and the worth of them for ſatisfaction to Juſtice did ariſe from the Union of the Humane nature with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in one perſon; ſo that the Godhead of Chriſt put an infinite value into his ſufferings. This he offers not to diſprove; and they have taken it up on better grounds then to part with it, becauſe he boldly cenſures it as an unſcriptural notion.</p>
            <p>In p. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> doth alſo undertake to give anſwer to ſome Texts produced to prove th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Chriſt was the Son of God in the Divine nature, The firſt is <hi>Joh. 10. 30. I and my Father are one,</hi> that is, (<hi>ſay they) one in the ſame ſubſtance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And a little after, That Chriſt did not intend himſelf to be the Son of God in the Divine nature only is apparent; Becauſe he ſpeaks of himſelf as he was the Son of God, not as he was not,</hi> viz. <hi>as he was God and man viſible, and not of the Divine nature only which was inviſible, and muſt have been an unſeen Son, which could not be underſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Text doth fully prove that Chriſt hath the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and therefore (without reſpect to his being made fleſh) was from Everlaſting begotten of the ſubſtance of the Father; and this generation is the foundation of that relative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Son, in which he did ſubſiſt before the World was This we ſay, and other Texts do ſo fully aſſert it, and manifeſt its lying in the foundation of the Chriſtian Religion, that I will not doubt to ſay he is an Heretick that doth deny it. In the following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> it is evident he miſerably begs the queſtion; it cannot (he ſaith) <hi>intend his Sonſhip in the Divine nature, becauſe in that only he was not the Son of God.</hi> But this he ſhould have proved, not dictated againſt the teſtimony produced. What he ſaith of the inviſibility of the Son in the Divine nature, may be as well applyed to the denial of the ſubſiſting of the Father, or Holy Spirit, who alſo are the inviſible God. And Mr. <hi>C.</hi> can never prove that it is neceſſary unto the being of the Son of God, that he ſhould be viſible. The other Texts minded by him do (divers of them) ſpeak expreſly of a perſon ſent into the world in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which was the Son of God; and in that he is called the Son of God, when found in faſhion as a man; it doth firmly prove the perſonal union of both natures in him; but not in the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105700:17"/> that he was not a Son, before he was a man, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would ſeduce his Readers to believe. And this may ſuffice to this Head alſo.</p>
            <p>His third poſition is, <hi>That he was the Word as God-man and man-God,</hi> or as he explains it p. 8. <hi>That the ſame Word and Son of God, God-man was made fleſh,</hi> &amp;c which falls in with his <hi>6th</hi> poſition p. 11</p>
            <p>How abundantly the Scriptures hold forth a diſtinction, betwixt the Word that took Humane nature, and the nature aſſumed by him, hath been already manifeſted; and that the Word was from Everlaſting with God, and was God, the Humane nature not ſo. And the abſurdity of his <hi>6th.</hi> theſis is obvious even to a Child; what was it for the Word to be made fleſh, but to become a man; and if he was God-man from Everlaſting, how could he be made a man in time? The truth is, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> fairly intimates his good-will to deny Chriſts coming of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> as concerning the fleſh; for in anſwer to this objection he ſaith, p. 11. <hi>He that was God and Man in Gods eye, was made ſo in our eye, when made or manifeſted in fleſh:</hi> So then he was a man before, it ſeems, only we knew it not; and his Humane nature he took not of the Virgin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but brought it from Heaven with him? If this be not his ſenſe, he ſpeaks nothing to the purpoſe; and if it be, I deſire he would ſpeak out in his next, and the abomination of it ſhall be farther detected. For the preſent he produceth nothing more that may give any ſeeming countenance to theſe notions, or in the leaſt free them from the higheſt abſurdity; I ſhall leave them therefore naked, as they are propoſed by him, and follow him to his fourth Theſis.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That as God-man he was a Creature,</hi> i. e. He was a Creature as God, as well as in his Humane nature. Verily Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> may as well perſwade us, That the Creature is God, as that God is a Creature. I will not ſuppoſe his Reader or mine, to be utterly Bruitiſh and without underſtanding, and therefore ſhall leave this idle and contradictious fiction to confute it ſelf alſo. Only I will add an expoſition of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. abuſed by him p. 10. where he falls in directly with the notion of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereticks; and would perſwade us, <hi>That if Chriſt be not here conſidered as the firſt-born of every Creature as being one of them, there is nothing in the Text.</hi> But the contrary is abundantly manifeſted by Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Biddle</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> his Catechiſm, from whence I ſhall tranſcribe enough to ſtop Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to inform thoſe that have not that Treatiſe by them.

            <p>As to what he adds about Juſtification, it ſhall be taken notice of in a more convenient place.</p>
            <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>C.</hi> cloſeth this Chapter with an affirmation, <hi>That he cannot yet be convinced of any thing written in his Body of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> (wherein himſelf owneth theſe things are found) <hi>of which he yet ſeeth cauſe to repent.</hi> Truly his blindneſs renders him an object of pity.

            </p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the conſideration of what the Scriptures ſay in this important Article of our Faith, let us hear what Mr.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105700:19"/> 
               <hi>Collier</hi> himſelf ſaith in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> under this Title, <hi>How this one God ſubſiſteth in three Perſons,</hi> p. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſum of all is this, That God is one Eternal infinite ſubſtantial Being, diſtinguiſhed into Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and in all three, are Divine, and diſtinct relative properties and operations, yet in all no one wills, no one acts without the other,</hi> Gen. 1. 1, 2, 26. Heb. 1. 2. Job 33. 4. And p. 43 <hi>And this truth,</hi> i. e. <hi>a plurality in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternal God, is clearly to be proved from the Old Teſtament even from the Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might be ſuppoſed by this his brief deſcription of the Deity, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is Orthodox in his opinion concerning the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son of God, though in many places he be ſingular in his expreſſions: And that his deſign wherein he is ſingular and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from others, is very charitable, <hi>viz.</hi> That his ſuppoſed abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of making two Sons, or the Sonſhip of Chriſt not to be the ſame at firſt as it was at laſt, might be avoided.</p>
            <p>Yet whoſoever throughly weighs his whole diſcourſe, cannot but obſerve that he ſpeaks at leaſt very doubtfully concerning any exiſtence that the Son of God had in the Divine nature, before he was made or manifeſt in fleſh.</p>
            <p>Add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> word, p. 11. § 6. <hi>That this word God-man was made fleſh.—Here it ſeems lyeth the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> would yet ſpeak more plainly, that if he think a right, a wrong opinion may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, from his ſeemingly affected obſcurity in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. What is the meaning of this, <hi>He that was God and man in Gods eye, was made ſo in our eye.</hi> Is it that God the Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſaw him as he was from Eternity, exiſting with him in the Deity in both natures God-man, or never exiſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s God the Son till he was made or manifeſt in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Becauſe of this obſcurity, and the jealouſies juſtly conceived that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> is very corrupt in his opinion concerning the pre-exiſtence of the Son of God in the Divine nature before he aſſumed fleſh; let it now be conſidered whether the Scriptures preſent the Lord Chriſt to us as being the Son of God in both natures only, even thoſe places of Scripture (among others) which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> by his falſe gloſſes would have us to think do ſo only preſent him to us.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105700:19"/>
            <p>Heb. 1. 8. <hi>But unto the Son he ſaith, Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever, a ſcepter of Righteouſneſs is the ſcepter of thy Kingdom, thou haſt loved Righteouſneſs and hated Iniquity, therefore God thy God hath anointed thee with the Oil of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein we have not only the unction of the Son of God men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but the reaſon of it: And that is plainly taken from his Everlaſting Divinity, Regality and Righteouſneſs. Becauſe he that is the Son of God, is God that made, and upholds, and rules over the world in Righteouſneſs, and loveth it, and hateth iniquity, therefore as the only fit perſon is he anointed by God the Father, his God and our God, to the Office of Mediatorſhip, which the whole Chapter treats of: And from the dignity of his Perſon as the Son of God, is divine adoration given to him, when as the Son of man, he came firſt into the world: And from thence alſo his preheminence, notwithſtanding his debaſement in the fleſh, continues with him above all his fellows.</p>

Hence is plainly inferr'd, not only his pre-exiſtence as the Son of God, before his choice and aſſumption of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> his taking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon him fleſh; but that he was alſo purely ſo ſubſiſting in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, as to ſtand indifferent as to the aſſumption of the Angelical or Humane nature into the Unity of his Perſon, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as he was pre-determined by the Decree, Councel and Covenant of God, in order to the work to which he was anointed.</p>

            <p>The Lord Chriſt did not then firſt acquire his being or relation unto God the Father as his Son: But being from Eternity the brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and expreſs Image of his Perſon, after he had by the appointment of his Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary undertaking, vailed his Deity, humbled himſelf and taken upon him the form of a Servant, and therein performed the work his Father gave him to do, he prays to be reſtored to the ſame, not any other, for there could be no greater Glory conferr'd upon him as to his Divine nature, then what he had with his Father before the world was.</p>
            <p>Joh. 6. 38. <hi>I came down out of Heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi>—Gal. 4. 4, 6. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come God ſent out his Son.—And becauſe you are Sons God hath ſent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In theſe Texts compared with their Contexts, you have again a full diſcovery of him who was by God the Father, anointed to be the Saviour of the world. His being in the Fleſh was now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105700:20"/> to all that converſed with him, it needed no proof, he carried about with him a ſelf demonſtration, <hi>that he was made of a Woman, made under the Law.</hi> The great thing that the <hi>Jews,</hi> and all the world were to be fully informed in and convinced of, was, that the Perſon now manifeſt in the fleſh, was the Saviour, the Chriſt, the Lord. And for the evidencing of this great and important truth, it was neceſſary that the Lord Chriſt ſhould not only ſpeak and do as never man before him ſpake and did, but alſo prove his deſcent, whence he was, and wherefore he came into the world. And in that reſpect, together with all the teſtimonies born of him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Heaven by God the Father and the holy Angels, we have him frequently aſſerting his Original himſelf, <hi>I came down from Heaven.</hi> Hence it was that the <hi>Jews</hi> at this ſeaſon took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for their murmuring, <hi>Jo. 6. 42. Is not this Jeſus the Son of Joſeph, whoſe Father and Mother we know, how is it then that he ſaith, I came down from Heaven.</hi> In anſwer to this Objection, the Lord Chriſt tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> that in order to a true ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Perſon, who and whence he was, it was neceſſary they ſhould be taught of God; <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Barjona, for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And that they might know his original, and his immediate and uninterrupted relation to God as his Father, notwithſtanding his then preſent ſtate of Humiliation in the Fleſh, he tells them from whence he was, who he was, and wherefore he came into the world. The <hi>medium</hi> he uſes to prove his relation to God as his Father, is not his being born of a Virgin, <hi>Abrahams</hi> or <hi>Davids</hi> Seed (though that be alſo true, and moſt proper to prove him who is the Son of God to be alſo that Son of man, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that was promiſed) But he proves it by his deſcent from Heaven, his ſeeing of the Father, (which no man ever did or could do) his being of God. And becauſe the exceptions to what he affirmed, both by the <hi>Jews</hi> and his Diſciples, were taken from his being in the fleſh; Therefore to ſhew that the Hypoſtatical Union of God and Man in him, had not deprived him of his dignity of the Son of God, he ſpeaks of himſelf under the notion as they apprehended him, of being the Son of Man as he then alſo was. And asks his Diſciples, <hi>what and if you ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was before,</hi> which is further explained <hi>Jo. 3. 13, 14. ch. 12. 32. Eph.</hi> 4. 10. His condeſcenſion to take upon him fleſh, to become the Son of Man, and in that nature to ſuffer death upon the Croſs, was no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105700:21"/> deprivation of his Divinity, nor derogation from his Perſon, he ſtill aſſerts, even from thence, his then preſent being in Heaven. The Divine and Humane nature ſubſiſting in his Perſon, had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the Deity out of Heaven, but by that intimate conjunction given the Humanity from the dignity of his Perſon, a claim to Heaven, and right of Aſcenſion thither. He did not therefore deſcend, that he might always remain upon earth, but that after he had finiſhed his Fathers work which he was to do in the fleſh, he might carry the Humane nature with him into Heaven, whither he was to aſcend again. So that ſince his uniting of the Humane to the Divine nature in his own perſon, whether he was ſpoken of as the Son of God according to his Divinity, or as the Son of <hi>David</hi> according to his Humanity, under which notion ſoever he was ſpoken of, either as the Son of God, or the Son of Man, he being in both natures but one entire perſon, was ſtill truly ſaid to be in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not that it was, or could ever be ſuppoſed that his claim to Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his being there, did ariſe from his being the Son of Man, but as he himſelf aſſerts from his coming down from thence, his coming, and being ſent from his Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining always with his Father, <hi>He and his Father being one.</hi> He that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended; there neither was, nor could there be admitted any change of the Perſon. It is alſo obſervable that <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. the ſame word is uſed for the ſending forth of the Spirit of his Son by God the Father, into the hearts of his adopted Sons, that is uſed for the ſending forth of his Son into the world. This is no ſlender evidence of the Eternity and Divinity of Chriſt, that he hath the ſame relation to the holy Spirit with the Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. It was the Spirit of Chriſt that was in the Prophets of old, that long before his Incarnation did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell thereof, and of his ſufferings, and the Glory that ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: <hi>David</hi> himſelf ſaid by his Spirit, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand till I make thine enemies thy footſtool,</hi> as to his Divinity he is the root of <hi>David,</hi> who according to his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was his off-ſpring, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
            <p>The Viſion of <hi>Iſaiah ch.</hi> 6. was true, and the voice of the Angels a real voice, who cried as to the time then preſent, <hi>holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> And if the Application of this viſion of the Prophet, and voice of the Angels by the Evangeliſt (<hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 41.) be alſo true, what more clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be given of the Lord Chriſts ſubſiſting in the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105700:21"/> before his deſcenſion from Heaven and aſſumption of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou Lord in the beginning haſt laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work of thine hands; they ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt; they ſhall wax old as doth a garment, and as a veſture thou ſhalt fold them up; and they ſhall be changed, but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall not fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe and many other the like Texts, is the Divinity of the Lord Chriſt fully aſſerted, and by the writings of the Apoſtles, directed by the Holy Spirit, ſince his Incarnation applyed to him. By whom we are given to underſtand, that the Prophets aforetime ſpake of our Lord Chriſt, and thereby is made known to us the dignity of his perſon, as the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega.</hi> But I would have Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ingeniouſly conſider, whether he or any other man, without this future revelation and explication, could have gathered any ſuch doctrine as the Manhood coexiſting with the Godhead in the perſon of Chriſt from all Eternity; or that he who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning laid the foundations of the Earth, and made the Heavens, was when he did this work Man as well as God; or that ſince this revelation and application of theſe ſayings to the perſon of Chriſt, can ſay any otherwiſe then that theſe titles and operations are referr'd to the Son of God as he ſubſiſted in his Divine nature with the Father. And if this be ſo, let Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> be convinc'd and acknowledge, that the Scriptures do ſometimes (and that frequently) ſpeak of the Son of God as in the Divine nature only, and not always as he was in both natures God and Man.</p>

            <p>Election as it is attributed to God may be variouſly conſidered: 1. There is frequent mention in Scripture of Election unto ſome function or office either Eccleſiaſtical or Political.</p>

            <p>The firſt is of thoſe who are choſen in Chriſt before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105700:23"/> of the world, unto the obtaining of Grace and Glory: A brief account of which I have already given. The reaſon he gives for this is, <hi>That the undertaking of Chriſt might be aſsured not to be in vain on the moſt ſpecial account,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He acknowledgeth then; That if there had not been a certain number given to Chriſt by the Father, who by effectual Grace ſhould be brought to believe in him, his undertaking might have been in vain: But this muſt not be: <hi>very true:</hi> But then if the whole of his undertaking muſt not be left at uncertainty; why ſhould any part of it be ſo? How Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will reconcile this with his other notions I know not. He goes on,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond ſort of ſpecial Election in the Goſpel is of All that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the Goſpel in truth, perſevering therein to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards he accounts theſe diſtinct from the ſpecial Elect; but for the preſent he makes this one branch of ſpecial Election: I ſhall allow him to alter his terms as he pleaſeth, if he find them unfit, and conſider his preſent notion, which is built upon this ſuppoſition, That many may and ſhall believe and obey the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and perſevere therein to the end, that receive no ſpecial Grace from God in the purſuit of his Electing Love, to enable them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or preſerve them therein, (which notion ſhall be examined in its proper place) And theſe are Elected on the foreſight of their Faith and Obedience and perſeverance therein. And here we might reaſonably expect, that <hi>Tho. C.</hi> in his <hi>Add. word,</hi> ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed the arguments urged againſt ſuch an Election by <hi>Th. C.</hi> in his B. of <hi>D.</hi> p. 444, 445, 446. But this he ſilently paſſeth over; and this ſudden change is the more to be taken notice of, becauſe he tells us in his Preface to that Book, <hi>That they are not the notions of ſudden conception, but the fruit and birth of many years travel; that he there preſents us with: and that he would have all his Doctrine to be compared with that Book; and either reconciled therewith or rejected.</hi> I know ſome will be ready to ſay,</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 9. and ſo addreſs my ſelf to conſider what proof of this notion he offers to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Election</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>under this conſideration is declared in theſe and the like Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 6. 40. &amp; 3. 16. &amp; 8. 31. Rom. 2. 7.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105700:23"/> Heb. 5. 9. Col. 1. 21, 23. Rev. 22. 14. All theſe Scriptures hold forth no more but the inſeparable connexion (as of the means with the end) of Faith and Obedience perſevered in, with Eternal Life and Salvation; not a tittle of the Election of any on the foreſight of theſe. <hi>He that holdeth out to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> which all the Elect ſhall do, being kept by the power of God through Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation; but this Grace, as well as future Glory, floweth to them from the eternal ſpring of Electing Love.</p>
            <p>Yea Mr. <hi>C.</hi> himſelf can tell us at another time, <hi>That Faith is no where ſtated in the Scriptures as the condition of Election; neither in reaſon can it be ſo, if we conſider what perſons are Elected to, and that is to believe and obey the Goſpel, to be holy here and happy hereafter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1, 2. Bod. of Divin. p. 445.</p>
            <p>And if Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will conſult thoſe that have written on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, he may find other arguments urged againſt this errour alſo; but perhaps his own may have the greateſt influence on him. I ſhall therefore leave that with him, and attend him in his farther offer of proof of the contrary opinion now; Thus he proceeds, p. 21. <hi>We may not ſo underſtand particular and ſpecial Election, as to derogate from the univerſal Grace and love of God to all men; nor from the truth of the Law of Grace, which calleth upon all, and encourageth all, and promiſeth life to all that do believe and obey the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> means by the univerſal Grace and love of God to all men he doth not here explain: But by the tenour of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in other places in his Book, his ſenſe appears to be; That God intended the Redemption and Salvation of all men in the death of his Son, and hath recovered them all out of their fallen ſtate, and put them into a capacity of obtaining Heaven, without his ſpecial Grace. And it is true, that the Doctrine of Election as revealed in the Scriptures, doth overthrow this fiction; but muſt it therefore be rejected, becauſe it will not comport with his errors? And whereas he ſuppoſeth that the Decree of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſalvation of the Elect oppoſeth his revealed will, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invitations unto ſinners in the Goſpel; this muſt be imputed to his ignorance of theſe things: He tells us not wherein he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the oppoſition doth lye; And whatever he thinks, their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is ſweet and full. There is a ſufficiency in Chriſt to ſave the whole world if they did believe on him; and there is a ſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation to every believer: And it is the will of God that ſalvation by Chriſt ſhould be tendered unto all where the Goſpel
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105700:24"/> comes on the terms mentioned therein; But the wickedneſs of mans heart, and his natural enmity to God being ſuch, as would render all this fruitleſs if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Where then is our making null the revealed will of God by his Decree, that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> talks of?

            <p>The Decree of God is one thing; his Command another; It is the latter that conſtitutes our duty, not the former. It doth not therefore follow, that becauſe many are called, and commanded to believe, and Life is tendred to them on Goſpel-terms; therefore many are choſen beſides the ſpecial Elect. But to the Text; <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> In the context Chriſt declares, 1. That there was a certain number given to him by the Father; which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> owns to be the ſpecial Elect. 2. That concerning theſe the will of God was, that they ſhould be brought to Inherit Eternal Life by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 40. 3. That although the natural pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of men is ſuch, that no man without ſpecial Grace can come to Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 44. yet theſe ſhould by the drawings of the Father be brought to him, <hi>All that the Father hath given me, ſhall come to me.</hi> 4. That theſe coming ſhould in no wiſe be rejected by him; and the reaſon thereof he renders, <hi>v.</hi> 38, 39. It is evident therefore the ſame perſons are ſpoken of in the end, that are intended in the beginning of <hi>v.</hi> 37. and Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> ſuppoſition of the contrary is without ground; and his reaſon for it ridiculous; <hi>It cannot be ſuppoſed (ſaith he) that him that cometh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is a promiſe to the firſt gift, for they ſhall come; that is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Elect ſhall believe in Chriſt; <hi>Ergo,</hi> There is no promiſe made of their ſalvation by him. <hi>Apage nugas!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which he diſcourſeth concerning the Book of Life, p. 22. if his notion of it were granted, makes nothing for him, unleſs he ſuppoſe that the revealed will of God, that declares and determines our duty, what we ought to do; and the Decree of God, or what

Rom.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
            <p>2. A Book is attributed to God in Scripture, not properly, but by a Figure called Anthropopatheia; the metaphor being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from wiſe men, who are wont diligently to ſet down in a Book thoſe notable things that they would keep in mind, and ſignifieth his providence with reſpect to, and moſt exact knowledge of all things, and in the Scriptures cited by Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> it ſignifies Gods ſpecial knowledge of his ſaved ones, concerning which the Apoſtle ſpeaks 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. which is as a certain Catalogue of thoſe whom God hath choſen unto Eternal Life by Faith in Chriſt: But Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith, they <hi>muſt</hi> be otherwiſe underſtood: His ſaying they muſt is no proof; and his reaſons are too weak to inforce it, His firſt is, <hi>Becauſe out of the Book of Life here mentioned many may be blotted.</hi> I anſwer, The expreſſion is Figurative, and is to be interpreted according to the ſcope of the place; as God is ſaid to blot out ſin, when he doth not impute it, ſo to blot out the name of one out of the Book of Life, that he doth not reckon among his ſaved ones, which he will make manifeſt in the day of judgement, when all the world ſhall know that he had no part therein; thus the affirmative being put for the contrary negative; the ſenſe is briefly this, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19. i. e. He ſhall have no part at all in it, and ſo likewiſe <hi>e contra,</hi> ch. 3. 5. <hi>I will not blot out his name out of the Book of Life,</hi> i. e.

               <hi>Election</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>is no ground to diſcourage any from believing;</hi> who ſaith it is? That crimination hath been abundantly anſwered by others without the help of his Scriptureleſs notion.</p>
            <p>The tenders of Life in the Goſpel are full of Grace, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to believe, equal and rational; and the promiſe of Life to the believer ſure and ſtedfaſt: Election is a ſecret and hidden thing, as to the concernment of particular perſons in it, which belongeth unto God; and as none can know their Election of God before Faith, ſo is it no way neceſſary that they ſhould do ſo in order to believing: for revealed things belong unto us and our Children, and we are bound to attend to them in that ſame order in which God hath revealed them: Now in the Goſpel is the Salvation of God revealed to loſt ſinners, and they, ſimply conſidered as ſuch, commanded to accept of it upon the terms propoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We come now to his laſt Section in this Chapter, which is worſe then all that goes before; yet here he gives us but a taſte of what he intends more largely to purſue afterwards. Thus he writes p. 23.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:105700:25"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture ſeems to import that many, yea very many (compared with the firſt elect and eſpouſed relation) ſhall obtain ſome great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, though below that of Election, and eſpouſed relation to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which he was to prove is, That beſides thoſe that are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to the obtaining of Grace and Glory, there are others choſen to be heirs of Glory on foreſight of their faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Election thereby. To make this good, he tells us of very many that ſhall obtain ſome great priviledge, though below that of Election. Such impertinencies are his writings full of, But we will take his meaning to be, That they he now ſpeaks of ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſecond Election, but not the firſt; which is a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but below that of eſpouſed relation to Chriſt. But then is he at variance with himſelf again; for thus he writes a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, p. 16. <hi>Whoever among the ſons and daughters of men, do ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe and obey the Goſpel, ſhall have the</hi> ſpecial relation <hi>to God and Chriſt therein, and the</hi> ſpecial benefit and ſalvation thereof. And this he ſuppoſeth many do beſides the ſpecial elect; And in this very Chapter he tells us, That faith and obedience with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance therein, renders perſons the objects of this Election; and certainly the Scriptures know no other eſpouſed relation to Chriſt, but what we have by Faith; neither are there greater promiſes in the Book of God, then thoſe that are made to perſons perſevering in faith and obedience; <hi>They ſhall inherit all things,</hi> Rev. 21. 7. But Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſuppoſeth that theſe believe, and perſevere with leſs help from God then the ſpecial Elect have.

Now in this Scripture the manifeſt deſign of the Pſalmiſt is, to ſet forth the Majeſty and Grace of Chriſts Kingdom, as he is the head and husband of his people, together with the glorious priviledges of the Church his Spouſe, in her marriage relation to him: And therefore in his deſcription of the Church, in that ſtate and honour unto which Chriſt hath advanced her, ſhe is compared to a Queen richly adorned, and attended (as with her Ladies of Honour) by the Virgins her companions; becauſe ſo it uſeth to be with Queens when brought in ſtate unto their Lord and Husband. And if we ſtrain the Metaphor (or Type) no farther, we have a good ſenſe of the words, and that which ſuits the deſign of the Text.

               <hi>It would be beneath the ſpirit and charity of the Goſpel, to allow no ſalvation (during the old Covenant) to any in the world beſides the elect Church of the Jews, and contrary to the Scripture,</hi> Act. 10. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>In what ſenſe the Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was choſen of God, I ſhewed before: That all are not <hi>Iſrael</hi> (elect of God to eternal life) that are of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (according to the fleſh) is certain; and I grant alſo, that in the time Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſpeaks of God had his remnant (though we have reaſon to think not many) in other Nations, unto whom he did by means ordinary or extraordinary manifeſt himſelf; and theſe did fear God, and work righteouſneſs, by which their Election of God was manifeſted: But that theſe did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the number of the ſpecial Elect, nor were of that Church which is Chriſts Spouſe, is utterly untrue, neither doth he attempt to prove it.

               </gap> be my plea for proceeding in my reply to this and the remaining part of his Book.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this Chapter p. 13. After he hath minded us of differing apprehenſions among men concerning the end of Chriſts death; That he may be ſure to outſtrip all, he tells us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt dyed for the world, that is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, the Heavens and Earth all things therein, the whole ſix days Creation that fell with man for the ſin of man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Certainly whatſoever the Scripture holdeth forth concerning the curſe brought upon the Creation by the ſin of man, and the future deliverance of the Creature from the vanity it now groans under, it cannot but ſound very harſh to Chriſtian ears, to hear, That their Saviour dyed for the Univerſe, yea for all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth, for every ſilly Bird that flies in the Air, yea and every Creature known in nature, even the vileſt, moſt periſhing and contemptible thing: Yea, how ridiculous might this notion be rendred; But I fear God, and therefore dare not dally with thoſe things wherein the dying of my precious Lord muſt be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. This woful miſtake he is caſt upon by the ambiguity of the word World, which he ſuppoſeth muſt always intend the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, but the abſurdity of that Hypotheſis abundantly appears if we look into divers Texts where the word is uſed, and can in no wiſe bear that ſenſe: Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> doth alſo aſſert univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſenſe in the next Section: Becauſe this word and the term <hi>All</hi> is ſometimes uſed in Scripture where Redemption

               <p>Fifthly, For the world accurſed, as under the power of Sathan, <hi>Joh. 7. 7. Joh. 14. 30. Joh. 16. 11, 33. 1 Cor. 2. 12. 2 Cor. 4. 4. Eph.</hi> 6. 12. and divers other ſignifications hath this word in holy Writ, which are needleſs to recount; Theſe I have rehearſed to ſhew the vanity of that clamour, wherewith ſome men fill their mouths, and frighten unſtable Souls, with the Scripture menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning <hi>World</hi> ſo often in the buſineſs of Redemption; as though ſome ſtrength might be taken thence for the upholding of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ranſome. <hi>Parvas habet ſpes Troja, ſi tales habet.</hi> If their greateſt ſtrength be but ſophiſtical craft, taken from the ambiguity of an aequivocal word, their whole endeavour is like to prove fruitleſs. Now as I have declared that it hath divers other accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Scripture, ſo when I come to a conſideration of their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105700:30"/> objections that uſe the word for this purpoſe; I hope by Gods aſſiſtance to ſhew, that in no one place wherein it is uſed in this buſineſs of Redemption, that it is or can be taken for all and every man in the world; as indeed it is in very few places beſides: So that as concerning this word our way will be clear, if to what hath been ſaid ye add theſe obſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as in other words, ſo in this, there is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſually an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereby the ſame word is ingemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a different ſenſe and acceptation: So <hi>Mat. 8. 22. Let the dead bury their dead: dead</hi> in the firſt place denoting them that are ſpiritually dead in ſin; in the next, thoſe that are naturally dead by a diſſolution of ſoul and body: So <hi>Joh. 1. 11. He came</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to his own,</hi> even all things that he had made, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and his own, i. e.</hi> the greateſt part of the people, <hi>received him not.</hi> So again <hi>Joh. 3. 6. That which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit: Spirit</hi> in the firſt place is the Almighty Spirit of God; in the latter, a ſpiritual life of Grace received from him. Now in ſuch places as theſe to argue, That ſuch is the ſignification of the word in one place, therefore in the other, were violently to pervert the mind of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus alſo is the word <hi>World</hi> uſually changed in the meaning thereof: So <hi>Joh. 1. 10. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not:</hi> He that ſhould force the ſame ſignification upon the word in that triple mention of it, would be an egregious gloſſer; for in the firſt, it plainly ſignifieth ſome part of the habitable Earth, and is tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; in the ſecond, the whole frame of Heaven and Earth, and is taken <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and in the third, for ſome men living in the earth, <hi>viz. unbelievers,</hi> who may be ſaid to be the world <hi>adjunctivè.</hi> So again <hi>Joh. 3. 17. God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved:</hi> where by the <hi>world</hi> in the firſt is neceſſarily to be underſtood, that part of the habitable world wherein our Saviour converſed; in the ſecond, all men in the world, as ſome ſuppoſe, ſo alſo there is a truth in it, for our Saviour came not to condemn all men in the world; for firſt, condemnation of any was not the prime aim of his coming; ſecondly, he came to ſave his own people, and ſo not to condemn all; in the third, Gods Elect, or Believers living in the world in their ſeveral generations, are meant, (although it is granted, they are not conſidered in this place as Elect, but under ſuch a notion as being true of them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105700:30"/> ſerves for the farther exaltation of Gods love towards them, which is the end here deſigned; and this is, as they are poor miſerable loſt creatures, in the world, of the world, ſcattered abroad in all places of the world, not tyed to <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> but diſperſed in any Nation, Kindred or Language under Heaven: <hi>ex eod.</hi> p. 201. the like is to be ſaid of parallel Texts) who were they whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſave, and none elſe, or he faileth of his purpoſe, and the endeavour of Chriſt is inſufficient for the accompliſhing of that, whereunto it is deſigned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no argument can be taken from a phraſe of ſpeech in the Scripture in any particular place, if in other places thereof, where it is uſed, the ſignification preſſed from that place is evidently denied, unleſs the ſcope of the place or ſubject matter do enforce it: For inſtance, God is ſaid to love the world, and ſend his Son; to be in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf, and Chriſt to be a propitiation for the ſins of the whole world: If the ſcope of the places where theſe aſſertions are, or the ſubject matter of which they treat, will enforce an univerſality of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be meant by the word <hi>World;</hi> ſo let it be without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll: but if not; if there be no enforcement of any ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation from the places themſelves, [as indeed there is not, but the contrary, that being ſpoken in them concerning the world, <hi>viz.</hi> their being loved of God: reconciled to him, forgiven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that in other Texts is plainly denied to be the portion of all and every perſon in the world] why ſhould the world there more ſignifie, all and every one, then in <hi>Joh. 1. 10.

               <p>That <hi>all Nations,</hi> an expreſſion of equal extent with that of the world, is in like manner to be underſtood, is apparent, <hi>Rom. 1. 5. Rev. 18. 3, 23.

               <p>Now as we have ſaid of the word <hi>World,</hi> ſo we may of the word <hi>All,</hi> wherein much ſtrength is placed, and many cauſeleſs boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are raiſed from it: That it is no where affirmed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Chriſt dyed for <hi>all men,</hi> or gave himſelf a ranſom for all men, much leſs for all and every man, we have before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: That he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, is expreſly affirmed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6.

            <p>The Scriptures that he produceth to prove that Chriſt died for all men, (<hi>viz.

Heb. 2. 9. 1 Joh. 2. 2. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. He tells us not how he thinks to enforce his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by them, but takes it for granted, that the word <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>All</hi> uſed in them muſt intend every individual perſon in the world, which Hypotheſis is abundantly overthrown in the foregoing lines;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105700:32"/> and there needs no farther anſwer to them; only I will briefly clear <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. that there may be no occaſion of ſtumbling left to any; The words are thus tranſlated, <hi>That he by the Grace of God ſhould taſt death for every man:</hi> the word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>for all.</hi> That this term <hi>every man</hi> is commonly uſed in Scriptures where ſome limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it muſt be allowed is certain, ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21 where <hi>every man</hi> can intend only thoſe to whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. with <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 5. And in this Chapter we have ſuch a deſcription of theſe <hi>All</hi> for whom Chriſt teſted death, as will by no means agree to all and every one, but the Elect only, <hi>v.</hi> 10. they are called many Sons to be brought to glory; <hi>v.</hi> 11. his Brethren and thoſe that are ſanctified, the Children that God gave him, <hi>v.</hi> 13. thoſe that were delivered from ſlaviſh fear of death, <hi>v.</hi> 15. I conclude therefore that the <hi>All</hi> here ſpoken of are all Chriſts ſheep and they only, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſeems to be aware, that he hath made very bold with the two laſt Texts cited by him, and that they will not bear the ſenſe he impoſeth upon them; and therefore he ſtates an objection againſt his application of them to the General ranſome. p. 14. And ſeeing he will have it brought in, I will take leave to frame the Objection my ſelf; (and know that the like might be urged with reference to the other Texts.)</p>
            <p>By the World in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. and the whole World, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. we may not underſtand all and every man in the world. becauſe that which is affirmed in theſe Texts, is not applicable to them; in <hi>Cor.</hi> thoſe that are called the World in <hi>v.</hi> 19. are called us (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) <hi>v.</hi> 18.

               <hi>That the Scripture clearly ſtates a general reconciliation, and a ſpecial: A general reconciliation of all things, all men, Col.</hi> 1. 20.

            <p>Theſe Texts do in no wiſe prove what Mr. <hi>C.</hi> doth produce them for. The firſt mentioned, <hi>viz. Col.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. is by divers learned and judicious men, interpreted according to the ſubject matter; <hi>all things,</hi> i. e. the whole Church or Family of God: in Heaven, <hi>viz. the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> and in Earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Elect ſtill in the world; even all that are reconciled, are ſo in Chriſt. And if he carry it farther, as ſome able Interpreters do alſo; and will have Angels included, and alſo the fabrick of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and the Creatures therein made for the ſervice of man; yet can it not on alike account be applyed to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo with reſpect to the things that are in the world; it can be but a metaphorical reconciliation, for they never ſinned, neither was God angry with them as breakers of his Law which they were not made under: Indeed as God commanded that all that did belong to <hi>Achan</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed for his ſin; ſo we may conceive, that the whole Creation that was made for mans uſe, came under a curſe for his ſake, and for the farther declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods hatred of ſin, muſt have periſhed with him, had it not been for the Mediator; and ſo Chriſt keeps off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he wrath that was pouring forth upon man, and all his ſubſtance (if I may ſo ſay) But this comes much ſhort of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> purpoſe, and is ſo far from proving any ſpecial reconciliation ariſing out of the general, that it is from hence manifeſt, that the laſt mentioned is a fruit and adjunct of the firſt. Indeed this Text, and that in the <hi>Romans,</hi> holds forth no more then this; That by the death of Chriſt all the Elect of God were virtually, and fundamentally reconciled to him, while they were ſinners, <hi>i. e.</hi> The price of their Redemption was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105700:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> then paid down to God, and accepted by him; But the actual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to their Souls, and their perſonal intereſt in it is upon believing: It is alſo evident that (eſpecially) the Text laſt mentioned doth hold forth the certain application of the Grace purchaſed and obtained by Chriſts death unto all thoſe for whom he died; which quite overthrows Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s notion of the General ranſome.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, p. 15. to Queſtion,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In what ſenſe may the world be ſaid to be reconciled to God, and to have ſin not imputed? he means;</hi> not to have ſin imputed.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are ſo far reconciled and ſin not imputed, as to have the Goſpel of reconliation truly tendred to them, that whoſoever do accept it on the ſame terms thereof might be reconciled and ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This anſwer is built upon his ſuppoſition, that the Goſpel ought to be, and is preached to all inanimate and animate Creatures as well as man; the folly of which notion I ſhall farther detect by and by: At preſent I make my reply onely with regard unto men, and even with reſpect to them, it is exceeding ſhort and weak. <hi>Reconciliation is tendred</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the world; and pardon of ſin is offered on Goſpel terms:</hi> Grant it: doth this prove that they are already reconciled and pardoned? But indeed the Goſpel is not preached to all men in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The word is ſo far reconciled and ſin not imputed, as that it ſhall not hinder their reſurrection, and reſtitution out of the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>If there be in theſe words any due coherence with what Mr. <hi>C.</hi> writes before, then doth he here preſent us with another new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the reſurrection of all thoſe Creatures that died, or ſhall die, before the reſtauration of the Univerſe; But then certainly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105700:34"/> the world muſt not only be reſtored, but either new made or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarged, otherwiſe there will not be found therein place for them all. But however two things with reference to man he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth undoubted;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all men are by the death of Chriſt recovered from their fallen ſtate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What he intends hereby, he doth not explain; and it is too evident that he little underſtands what the redemption and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of man out of his loſt and lapſed ſtate means.

            <p>For the preſent we have only his word for it, without any proof tendred.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the reſurrection of all men (veſſels of wrath as well as veſſels of mercy) is a fruit of their being reconciled to God by Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſeeing the wicked are raiſed for no other end, but that they may be brought to a juſt, though fearfull, Judgment, and are raiſed immortal that they may be capable of enduring the fire that ſhall never be quenched, I cannot ſee that this is any proof of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redeemed by Chriſt, more then the Devils, that muſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their ſentence from him in that day. And whereas he cites 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. it gives no countenance to his notion: The Apoſtle ſaith indeed, <hi>v. 21. That by Chriſt came the reſurrection from the dead;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 22. that <hi>all ſhall be made alive in him:</hi> But who are theſe all? all and every one of the ſons of men? No certainly: for to <hi>be made alive</hi> in this Text, doth not ſignifie ſimply the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body, in which the wicked have a ſhare alſo; but their reſurrection to a bleſſed immortality, to bear his image who is the Lord from Heaven, confer <hi>v.</hi> 45.—50. In this Context <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are oppoſed as two publick perſons; and the term <hi>all</hi> is to be expounded accordingly: All that were in <hi>Adam</hi> as their head and repreſentative, dyed in him when he fell; And ſo all that were in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as their head and repreſentative, ſhall be made alive in and by him; even all us, believers, they that are Chriſts, of whom he is the firſt fruits, <hi>v.</hi> 23. And indeed throughout this Chapter
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105700:34"/> the Apoſtle manifeſts, that it is the happy and joyfull reſurrection of the Saints that he is ſpeaking of, and all his reaſoning thereabout is accordingly ſuited to ſuch: And it is granted, that the redeemed of the Lord have a reſurrection unto life and glory, by virtue of their intereſt in Chriſt, who dyed and roſe again: So then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection conſidered as the ſpring of Believers happineſs, and their glorious priviledge, came by Chriſt: But how Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will evince that there is the like reaſon to referr the reſurrection of the wicked, which is only unto condemnation, unto their redemption by Chriſt, I ſee not. He proceeds:</p>
            <p>—<hi>And the ſecond death ſhall be for ſin againſt the New Covenant and G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If there be any kind of argument in theſe words to Mr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>If Chriſt had not dyed for all men, and reconciliation to God by him been tendred to them on Goſpel-terms, they had not been liable to the ſecond death. But all that do not believe and obey the Goſpel, muſt dye the ſecond death;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſt dyed for them, and procured non-impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin to them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I deny the major Propoſition: Sinners are guilty of damnation by the breach of the Law, though they never hear the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And immediately <hi>Th. C.</hi> will deny the minor, as we ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Scripture cited by him, <hi>viz. Joh.</hi> 3. 19. proves indeed, That where the objective light of the Goſpel is afforded to a people, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in plain terms Mr. <hi>C.</hi> doth not think, that all that have not faith in Chriſt ſhall be damned, as his minor Propoſition ſuppoſeth; though for the preſent he is willing to pretend ſo, that he may thereby prove they are redeemed; for thus he writes, p. 26.</p>
            <p>

But even theſe are under the firſt Covenant, which requires of them perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the moral Law, or Law of nature, which (if they have not the written Law neither) is ſo far written, even in their hearts, as that they are a Law unto themſelves; and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable in the breach of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>That there is a more ſpecial deſign of Grace in the death of Chriſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>the ſalvation of his Elect of his Church, whoſe peculiar priviledge it is, that the bloud of Chriſt is ſhed for them for the</hi> remiſſion of ſin: And they will perhaps wonder at the mans <hi>acumen,</hi> that hath found out ſuch a notable diſtinction of non-imputation of ſin; from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin; the one of which belongeth to the reprobate, the other to the Elect; though <hi>Paul</hi> took them to be of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105700:35"/> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 7, 8. But I cannot ſtay to remark every abſurdity in his Book; and therefore let this paſs:</p>
            <p>The glorious and wonderful deſign of free Grace to redeem and ſave to the utmoſt all the Elect, by Jeſus Chriſt, I adore: and to own that there was any end or deſign of God in the death of his Son, which was not perfectly accompliſhed thereby I dare not: But I ſhall proceed with Mr. <hi>C.</hi> it not being my purpoſe (as I ſaid at firſt) to enter upon a full diſcuſſion of theſe points, or to urge the arguments that might be pleaded againſt his opinion, but only to clear our way of that rubbiſh that he hath caſt into it.</p>
            <p>He diſcourſeth in the next place of the Preaching of the Goſpel, and he is as liberal here (and good reaſon for it) as he was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the extent of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The deſign of God (ſaith he) in his Goſpel Grace by the death of his Son, being thus univerſal to the whole world in this threefold ſenſe as hath been mentioned; Hence it is that the Goſpel muſt be preached to the whole Creation,</hi> &amp;c. He grants indeed p. 16. <hi>That it is eſpecially to be publiſhed to men who were concerned in the ſin and fall, But it is and may be truly preached to the whole Creation, though they hear it not, nor underſtand it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe in this particular, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> may truly ſay he hath not followed Authors, for I know none before him that have been ſo fond as to aſſert what here he doth; though in other things it is evident that he hath imbibed the notions of divers Hereticks that have been before him: Although I muſt confeſs the Papiſts in ſome of their Legends tell many odd ſtories to this purpoſe; and we may collect from thence what ſome of them thought in this matter. And although all Proteſtants deride their foppery; that will not diſcourage Mr. <hi>C.</hi> from joyning with them in this and other things; for he hath obſerved (as he tells us p. 59.) <hi>That the Proteſtants run themſelves too much in both principle and practice, beyond</hi> (almoſt) <hi>all works of Charity;</hi> amongſt which perhaps he reckons Preaching to Birds and Beaſts, Stones and Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I ſhould recite to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſome of the ſtories they tell of St. <hi>Francis</hi> his Preaching oft to the Birds, and how affectionately they heard him: his converting a ravenous Wolf, from his rapine to a tame and harmleſs life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of Father <hi>Bede</hi> his Preaching to the Stones, when he was blind, and his naughty Boy led him to a heap of Stones inſtead of a company of Men, and how in the cloſe of his Devotion they all cryed out with a loud voice <hi>Amen.</hi> How
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105700:36"/> he would approve of theſe things I know not; but others would think I intended to make him ridiculous; and therefore I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; only if he will allow me freely to impart my thoughts with him, I ſhall ſay this, That I think Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would have been much more innocently imployed, if he had thus ſpent his time, and never Preached and Printed to men the lamentable ſtuff that we have in this Book.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider what proof of this notion he offers to us.</p>
            <p>There are two Scriptures produced by him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105700:36"/> 
               <hi>Heaven</hi> is put for <hi>God;</hi> yet it is ſo uſed not according to its proper ſignification, but figuratively <hi>per metonymiam adjuncti;</hi> for <hi>him that dwells in Heaven.</hi> It doth not therefore follow that we may take it in that ſenſe wherever we meet with it; But what he means by this I know not, unleſs he would have the Goſpel Preached not only to the whole viſible Creation, but alſo to the Devils, for they are under God. Neither know I what to make of that which follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Goſpel may be truly Preached to the whole Creation, though they hear it not, nor underſtand it: and thus we muſt underſtand</hi> Col. 1. 23. <hi>For the Goſpel was not then Preached in the hearing of all men, nor in the hearing of the whole Creation, yet it was Preached to all the Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this were true, the Apoſtles needed not to have gone abroad into the world to have preached the Goſpel to every Creature; But I am perſwaded if one at <hi>London</hi> ſhould pretend that he daily preached the Goſpel to the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that hear him not; or to the animate and inanimate Creatures that either are not capable of hearing or underſtanding what he ſaith; many would laugh at his folly, and conclude the man was under a <hi>Delirium;</hi> but none would think that he truly preached the Goſpel to any of theſe, nor yet that it was worth their while to refute his conceit by argument. Yea but thus we <hi>muſt</hi> underſtand <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> were doubtleſs the greateſt Tyrant in the world, if he could force our underſtandings to aſſent to ſo great an abſurdity: But his words are but wind, we have our liberty ſtill to think otherwiſe; eſpecially ſeeing his reaſon for it is ſo weak; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>though the Goſpel was not then preached in the hearing of all the Creation, yet it was preached to all the Creation:</hi> which in plain terms amounts to no more then this: It muſt be ſo becauſe <hi>Tho. Collier</hi> ſaith it was ſo.</p>
            <p>This needs no anſwer, <hi>valeat quantum valere poteſt.</hi> We may conclude, this notwithſtanding, that the Goſpel was preached in the hearing of all it was preached to.</p>
            <p>In the next place he tells us, <hi>That the works of God do preach the Goſpel to the whole Creation.</hi> His notion of <hi>The preaching of the Goſpel by the works of God,</hi> we ſhall meet with again, and farther examine preſently: in the mean time we might enquire what theſe works of God are that preach to the whole Creation in his ſenſe; for ſurely the works of God that preach, muſt not be the ſame with the whole Creation preached to: But however Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſcape for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105700:37"/> writing thus; I ſhould incurr the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nſure of idleneſs if I ſhould purſue ſo fruitleſs an enquiry. I will therefore leave it off; and proceed to the doubt or queſtion that he moves, and endeavours to ſolve p. 17.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>If Chriſt dyed for the ſins of the world; and if God had a real deſign of good-will and Grace to all men, in his general love, why then is not the Goſpel preached to all men? whence is it tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the greateſt part of the world have been, and ſtill are without the Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> had not been conſcious to himſelf that his previous diſcourſe had been very vain and futilous, he needed not to have moved this doubt; having already concluded, <hi>that a man may preach the Goſpel to the whole Creation, though they hear him not, nor underſtand him;</hi> and that it is alſo <hi>preached to all by the works of God:</hi> But the truth is, notwithſtanding all he hath ſaid or can ſay, there is great weight in what he here ſuggeſts. For certainly if Chriſt had given himſelf a ranſome for all men, ſeeing none can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit thereof without Faith, and none can believe on him, of whom they have not heard; he would not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed things in his providence, that multitudes of theſe ranſomed ones, ſhould never have knowledge thereof: But we ſee that things are ſo ordered, <hi>Ergo,</hi> He never intended to give himſelf a ranſome for all men; in Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> ſenſe. Let us hear what Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith to theſe things.</p>
            <p>The firſt branch of his anſwer to this enquiry, as propoſed by himſelf, hath nothing in it but a repetition of his former errour, about the preſent recovery of all men out of their fallen ſtate; which hath already on good grounds been rejected; and he here gives it no inforcement: He adds:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Goſpel hath been and ſtill is preached to the whole world by the works of God, and his common goodneſs to men,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1, 2. Rom. 10. 18. Pſal. 145. 8, 9. Rom. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>The queſtion is about that preaching of the Goſpel that is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means to beget faith, and ſo infers the duty of thoſe to whom it is ſo preached to believe and obey it; That it is ſo preached by the works of God, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in this Treatiſe flatly denies: we reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one paſſage to this purpoſe but a little before: I cannot think therefore that he at all ſatisfies his own Conſcience in this anſwer; but only to ſerve a turn, thruſts in this notion to am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Reader. He doth not at all explain himſelf in what ſenſe he ſuppoſeth the works of God preach the Goſpel: Indeed his notion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105700:37"/> is utterly falſe, and therefore we need not wait for his explication of it; neither do the Scriptures quoted by him prove any ſuch thing: By the works of God, we grant, his Eternal Power and Godhead is knowable to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons of men, which leaves them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe in that they worſhip him not as God: and by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon goodneſs, is his patience and long-ſuffering of the Veſſels of wrath manifeſted, which is a further witneſs againſt them in their impenitency and rebellion againſt him: And this is all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures produced by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſpeak: There is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> a word of preaching the Goſpel in any of them; except in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. which is not by the works of God, but by a Miniſtry ſent forth from God for that work, as the whole context doth manifeſt, which is alſo quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to prove that none can believe without that means; notwithſtanding this ſuppoſed preaching of the works of God. So then though the Apoſtle apply thoſe words in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, either by alluſion to them, or more directly; yet doth he in no wiſe teach; that the <hi>Heavens, Sun, &amp;c.</hi> preach the Goſpel, but rather the contrary. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. There is mention made of a double medium of the revelation of God to the Sons of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> His Works, and his Word: what the works of God teach, and what the efficacy of their teaching is, the Apoſtle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth <hi>Rom. 1. 19. ad finem.</hi> Unto the word of God the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt aſcribeth much more; even all ſaving effects, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. and herein its excellency beyond the other is manifeſted. He proceeds,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Though there is no other name given under Heaven among men whereby they may be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4. 12. <hi>yet we muſt own that many have been, and may be ſaved by that name, that never heard of him, and ſo could not have Faith in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this it muſt be granted that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſpeaks to the purpoſe, and hath ſaid ſomething that gives real countenance to his notions, and directly overthrows that which hath generally been the received Doctrine of the Proteſtants; yea razeth the foundation of Goſpel Grace, And therefore here we might have expected ſome formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments to drive Chriſtians from that ſtrong hold of their common faith. <hi>That believing in Chriſt is the only way to Glory;</hi> But how miſerably he faulters in his proof notwithſtanding his ſtrange confidence, we ſhall immediately diſcern. I deſire the Reader to bear in mind, That perſons adult, and endued with reaſon, are the ſubjects of this diſcourſe. Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s drift then is to ſhew, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105700:38"/> it would grate upon this notion, that all the world ſhould not hear of Chriſt, if there were no other way to be ſaved by him, but believing in him, yet it is otherwiſe, if many may be ſaved by him, without faith in him, which they could not have but by hearing; And that many have, and may be ſaved without that, we <hi>muſt own.</hi> Dictator like! But why muſt we own it? Becauſe if we will not own this, <hi>Tho. C.</hi> cannot prove that all men are rede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med. And verily if we do own it, we muſt directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Apoſtle, who ſaith, <hi>That without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. And that he there intends believing in God by Chriſt, in whom alone we can know him to be a rewarder of all that diligently ſeek him, the whole ſcope of that Chapter doth manifeſt; and if Mr. <hi>C.</hi> think meet to deny it, I ſhall God aſſiſting, evince the certainty thereof, beyond his contradiction. And as he at preſent doth not, ſo I am aſſured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, nor his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with him, cannot produce one Text of Scripture that gives countenance to his notion.</p>
            <p>That kind of proof which he offers, I will now conſider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we may not ſuppoſe that any ſhall dye the ſecond death for not believing in the Son of God as crucified, that never heard of him,</hi> Rom. 10. 14.</p>
            <p>What there is in theſe words that may any ways ſtrengthen his notion, I cannot imagine: The argument is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>None ſhall dye the ſecond death</hi> for not believing, <hi>which have not heard of Chriſt:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But many that have not heard of him do dye the ſecond death:</hi> Ergo, <hi>many may be ſaved without faith in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope by this kind of arguing he will not infect many with his principles; we have already ſaid and proved, That though diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel, be not chargable on thoſe that never heard it; yet are they under the curſe of Gods holy Law, and muſt dye the ſecond death, for their breach thereof, ſeeing they remain ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the only remedy: And in the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle cited by him, he ſuppoſeth, That there is no ſalvation to be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling upon the Lord; no calling upon the Lord without Faith, no Faith without hearing; <hi>Ergo,</hi> without hearing no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He goes on,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And we</hi> muſt <hi>likewiſe underſtand, that there hath been a ſufficiency of teaching, under all the miniſteries of God to the world, to bring them to the knowledge of God, and ſo to ſalvation by that name, (though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105700:38"/> to them) and to leave all others without excuſe, which could not be were there not a ſufficiency of teaching therein,</hi> Rom. 1. 19, 20, 21 &amp; 2. 1.</p>
            <p>Here we have Mr. <hi>C.</hi> again (as if he conceited himſelf in St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair) impoſing his Magiſterial dictates upon us: This we muſt know; and that we muſt underſtand; but no warranty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of tendred beſides his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; and though perhaps he will take it amiſs that his authority is rejected, and may think with himſelf, <hi>Si hoc non ſit probationum ſatis, neſcio quid ſit ſatis;</hi> yet I ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mptorily deny, and prove the contrary to, what he here aſſerts, and ſuppoſeth undeniable; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a ſaving knowledge of God attainable out of Chriſt.</hi> This is firſt, contrary to the whole tenor of the Scripture, that repreſents God as a conſuming fire to all that are out of Chriſt; a God that will by no means clear the guilty; and that his pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and grace is made known to the ſons of men only in and by the Mediator; life and immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel; and thus it was from the beginning, the foundation of the Church, after the fall of man was laid in the promiſe of ſending Chriſt to be its Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no knowledge of God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but that whereby we know him to be a juſt God and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; and this we cannot know but in and through Chriſt, who was ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is againſt the expreſs teſtimony of Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 14. 6. I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh vnto the Father but by me.</hi> And again ch. 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent into the world,</hi> not to know God and be ignorant of Chriſt, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> dreameth: And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. where the efficacy, and ſaving fruit of Chriſts death is declared to belong only to thoſe who by him do believe in God; and that it is God conſidered as raiſing him from the dead, and giving him glory (ſo teſtifying his acceptance of the price that Chriſt payed for the redemption of ſinners) that is the object of our faith and hope. More might be added, but I haſten.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is alſo contrary to the experience of all that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. There are ſome proud Hypocrites indeed, that are alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law: that think they can pleaſe God and truſt in him without a Mediatour; but a poor convinced ſinner, unto whom the Commandment is come with power; and he by it is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the holineſs of God, and the exceeding ſinfulneſs of his ſin;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105700:39"/> can find no reſt until he have Chriſt revealed in him; all thoughts of God out of a Mediatour, are breaking and terrible to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he put his truſt in God, nor dares he once to think of an approach to him, until he have ſome knowledge of the meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of mercy and Juſtice, and how righteouſneſs and peace did kiſs each other in the undertaking of a crucified Saviour.</p>
            <p>That which he farther ſuppoſeth in the words recited is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the works of God without his word, are a ſufficient means to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

            <p n="2">2. The Condition of thoſe Nations that enjoy not the word of God, is ſuch as plainly beſpeaks them to be in the Region of the ſhadow of death: The Apoſtle diſcourſeth of ſuch <hi>Rom. 1. 19. &amp;c.</hi> and aſſures us their enmity to God is ſuch, as renders ineffectual the conviction they have of a Deity, by his works; and that notwithſtanding this means, they grow worſe and worſe, and neceſſarily periſh at laſt, if not converted and ſaved by the Grace of Chriſt revealed in the Goſpel, yea, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoſe that know the ſtate of the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> and they will fully reſolve you, That there is no proof of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion amongſt them.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtanding of what I have to ſay in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to him; I ſhall premit theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I do acknowledge, That all men have a liberty of will, or freedom of chooſing with reference to thoſe things that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them. And this I take to be an inſeparable adjunct of all humane acts.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:105700:40"/>2. This liberty conſiſts in a rational ſpontaneity: He acts freely, that is under no <hi>coaction</hi> (which alone is oppoſed to liberty in the true notion thereof) but doth what the laſt and practical judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own underſtanding dictates to him. So that one that acts neceſſarily may yet act moſt freely. God cannot but love and delight in himſelf, and order all things to his own glory; yet is he an agent in every reſpect moſt abſolutely free: The good Angels now confirmed by Grace in their ſtation, and glorified Saints, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but love God, chooſe and delight in perfect obedience to his holy will: yet in all this are they free agents, becauſe they are thus determined by no external force, but by the dictate of their own underſtanding. And on the contrary, the Devils, and fallen man, are by their own wickedneſs determined to ſin, and that onely, yet are they free in the choice thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That God made man upright, and ſo capable of yielding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the whole will of God, according to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in which he ſtood related to him; but he ſought out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and by his voluntary defection from, and rebellion againſt God, fell ſhort of the Glory of God, and loſt that rectitude of nature which was concreate with him, and became blind, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and dead to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Man having thus wickedly and wilfully loſt, and caſt away his power of obeying God, doth infer no unrighteouſneſs in the Law of God, ſtill requiring and commanding them to do that which is Juſt, and Holy and Good; neither doth it infer the leaſt obligation on God to recover him out of his loſt eſtate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Although man in his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pſed eſtate, hath ſuch a principle of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God reigning in him, that he cannot, until converted by effectual Grace, chooſe that which is right in the ſight of God, yet doth he freely put forth a poſitive act of his will in refuſing mercy tendered on Goſpel terms.</p>
            <p n="6">6. So then the Queſtion is not ſo much, whether men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>left to themſelves, and the common helps afforded them, may believe if they will?</hi> But whether any ſuch <hi>will believe;</hi> and not rather finally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God, and refuſe his Grace tendred to them in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Theſe things duly conſidered, tend to obviate the cavils of Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> and to detect his miſtakes. He aſſerts in the firſt Section, p. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That ſuitable to the means and Miniſtries men are under, there is a capacity both of power and will in all men</hi> (that are not debilitated of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105700:40"/> the ordinary capacities of men) <hi>to underſtand, believe and obey the Lord in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this and other following paſſages, it appears that by <hi>univerſal Grace,</hi> Th. C. means <hi>the ſufficiency of the humane nature,</hi> which is it, and not Grace, that he deſires to exalt; and as his notions are the ſame in this matter with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> ſo is there the ſame deceit and aequivocation in his uſing the term <hi>Grace,</hi> which they ſought refuge in: and therefore let none be blinded with that ſaying of his in the ſame Section, <hi>That this capacity both of power and will, is of God;</hi> For <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth as much; and it amounts to no more then the acknowledgement of our endowment with natural abilities by God who is our Creator: All theſe are from God in a <hi>way of nature,</hi> but ability to believe and obey the Goſpel is from him in a <hi>way of ſpecial Grace,</hi> which is that we plead for; and deny that a natural unregenerate man is capable, of ſaving knowledge of, or yielding obedience to, the will of God in the Goſpel, otherwiſe then as a dead Soul is capable of being quickened by the Almighty power of the Spirit of Chriſt. This the Scripture is full and expreſs in: I will inſtance in a Text or two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We read</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; For they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can be know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle doth in the context divide all men into two ſorts: Natural and Spiritual: The laſt have the mind of Chriſt, and are made acquainted with the Grace of the Goſpel, through the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual working of the Spirit, by which they are born again; the other, <hi>viz.</hi> natural men, unregenerate perſons (even the wiſeſt and beſt of them) <hi>receive not the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> i. e. the Doctrines of the Goſpel; becauſe they are without any Spiritual diſcerning of the glory that is in them, remaining under the power of darkneſs; they are accounted <hi>fooliſhneſs,</hi> and as fooliſh things, are ſlighted and rejected by them: <hi>Neither can they know them,</hi> viz. ſavingly and effectually, <hi>for they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> i. e. by the enlightening, and teaching of the Spirit of God; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>But I find divers exceptions laid againſt this interpretation of the Text by Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> p. 42. &amp; 43. which I ſhall here remove out of the way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He expounds this term <hi>the natural man,</hi> by, the <hi>ſenſual man:</hi> as if all unregenerate perſons were not intended thereby, but only
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105700:41"/> ſome of the moſt bruitiſh among them; which is quite againſt the Apoſtles ſcope, whoſe deſign is to ſhew, that God hath made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world, and that the principal men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſtrangers to the things of the new Covenant, <hi>which eye hath not ſeen, &amp;c.</hi> ch. 1. 20. &amp; 2. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſuppoſeth the Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles</hi> that would not come to the Goſpel light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be intended. But this alſo is plainly to contradict the Apoſtle, who ſpeaks of both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and particularly thoſe of them to whom the Goſpel was preached; as you may ſee moſt evidently in his foregoing diſcourſe; and theſe when the things of Gods Spirit were propoſed to them, received them not, but eſteemed them fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>His third exception is plainly ridiculous; He ſaith, <hi>All where the Goſpel comes ſhould underſtand and believe it, but its th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe only that by the Word and Spirit of the Goſpel, do believe and obey it, that have this ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi> This we plead, That although all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom they are tendered, ought to receive the things of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; yet no unconverted man doth ſo; the reaſon is in part, becauſe he cannot underſtand them; but they are fooliſhneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to him, and accordingly rejected by him; and to confute this, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> tells us that no unbeliever hath this underſtanding indeed; but if he did believe and obey he ſhould have it; as if to obey and believe the Goſpel, were not to receive the things of Gods ſpirit: The ſum is this, If he did believe, he might believe, and if he were not ignorant, he might underſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He endeavours to perſwade us, that it is only ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Goſpel myſteries as is proper to grown Chriſtians, that the unconverted man is uncapable of, and how repugnant this is to the whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, I leave every one to judge: Thus he concludes his futilous cavil:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that it ſuppoſeth not any impoſſibility for the darke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fain lye hid under the darkneſs of his ambiguous terms: This Scripture doth not ſuppoſe indeed but that the darkeſt and worſt of men, may be enlightened, and quickened, by the power of Gods ſpirit working with the word: But that every man, which hath only the natural accompliſhments of a man, may underſtand and obey the Goſpel if it be Doctrinally propoſed to him, in the exerciſe of that ability which he hath in his lapſed ſtate, is utterly denied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this Text; and <hi>Tho. C.</hi> convict thereby of falſhood, who affirms it.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:105700:41"/>
            <p>The ſecond Scripture which I ſhall oppoſe to his forementioned aſſertion, is <hi>Joh. 6. 44. No man can come to me except the Father which ſent me draw him.</hi> Chriſt doth here aſſert, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Goſpel be preached to men, their natural impotency is ſuch, that they cannot come; yea their enmity ſuch that they will not come, unleſs the Father draw them, <hi>viz.</hi> by thoſe effectual teachings, and that illumination, by which alone this impotency is cured in the Elect. <hi>v.</hi> 45.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Th. C.</hi> makes his exceptions likewiſe againſt this Text, p. 30 but to very little purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He endeavours to perſwade us that this <hi>drawing of the Father,</hi> is the ſame with the preaching of the Goſpel, and ſo common to all that hear the ſound thereof; which the Text will in no wiſe admit, ſeeing it is of ſuch that hear the Goſpel that Chriſt ſpeaketh, amongſt whom ſome are thus drawn, others not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſaith they cannot, becauſe they will not, and that the one is not without the other.</hi> We grant this, they neither can nor will, without ſpecial Grace come to Chriſt: neither are men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned meerly for their impotency, but for their wilfulneſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Goſpel, but this helps not Mr. <hi>C.</hi> at all. And whereas he gives an account in ſome particulars why they will not, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Becauſe they are habituated in ſin, and accuſtomed to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 2. Becauſe of the influence that the Devil hath upon them: I grant that theſe things do obſtruct and hinder perſons from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt; but I muſt tell him alſo, That the firſt and main reaſon of their refuſal is quite paſſed over by him, and that is, the natural enmity that is in their Souls to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
            <p>The third Scripture is <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. with other paralel Texts that declare all perſons unconverted, to be <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> and then certainly uncapable in that condition to put forth any truly ſpiritual vital act, in receiving and obeying the Goſpel of Chriſt; ſeeing they are without that principle of life, from whence ſuch acts muſt flow. Unto this Mr. <hi>C.</hi> replies p. 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a great miſtake to think and ſpeak as if men were as dead and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to believe and obey the Goſpel as a ſtock or a ſtone, or as men that are naturally dead; this is a ridiculous and untrue imagination:</hi> and ſo proceeds with his unlearned eloquence to ſet forth the folly of giving any thing in command to a ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to theſe things I ſay;</p>
            <p>1. All men have indeed rational Souls; and none beſides Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:105700:42"/> will be ſo ridiculous as to to talk at ſuch a rate as if <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi> were in the ſame capacity of being wrought upon by exhortations, promiſes and threatnings; we acknowledge that theſe are proper moral inſtruments in their own nature ſuited to work upon the underſtandings, wills and affections <hi>of men,</hi> and to produce the effects of Faith and Obedience in them; and ſeeing theſe faculties are the principle and ſubject of all actual obedience, it is alſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that there is in men a natural remote paſſive power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obeying the Goſpel which is not in ſtocks and ſtones: but this power is never actually put forth, nor can be, without the effectual Grace of God working in them both to will and to do: ſo that this notwithſtanding, as a ſtone or Corps cannot perform any operation of which natural life is the principle, becauſe they have it not; neither can a man in his fallen ſtate put forth an act of ſpiritual life, becauſe he is without that Life and Grace that is the principle thereof: For as the Soul is to the Body, with reſpect to natural life, ſo is the new nature to the Soul, with reſpect to a moral, or ſpiritual life.</p>
            <p>That which he offers that he might eſcape the force of this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is ſo remote from the evident ſcope of the Texts inſiſted on; that I ſhall not need to return any particular anſwer thereto, but leave his errour cruſhed under the weight of theſe ſavings of the holy Ghoſt, who hath in them ſtained the pride of all fleſh: Only I could wiſh that they into whoſe hands theſe lines may come, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lſo conſult Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his Diſcourſe of the Spirit: where he doth largely plead and vindicate theſe Texts againſt the <hi>Pelagians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> &amp;c. from whom Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath drank in theſe notions. For my own part, I had not now produced them, but only that I might take this opportunity to remove his objections againſt their true ſenſe, ſuppoſing this a convenient place for that work; ſeeing my deſign is only to remove his cavils out of the way of weak Chriſtians; and not to handle any point my ſelf, farther then in the purſuit thereof I am led to: I paſs therefore a multitude of other Scriptures that contradict his notion, and ſhall attend him, in his proof offered, and diſcover the weakneſs and inſufficiency thereof.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing which he ſaith proves his opinion is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe it is the duty of all men (ſuitable to the mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry they have been under) to believe and obey God.</hi> And after he hath by divers Texts proved this, which none denies, he adds;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which proves a capacity in men to anſwer his will, or we muſt reflect on God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:105700:42"/>
            <p>Were man to be conſidered in his primitive ſtate, as he came out of the hands of God, there were ſome weight in this reaſoning, But to ſuppoſe that the duty of man muſt be meaſured by his power and ability in his fallen ſtate, is fond, and groundleſs: He cannot ſin himſelf from under obligation to duty; Though he looſe the image of God, that rectitude of nature, by his ſin, that enabled him to obey God, yet the moſt high doth not looſe his right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him, that which is juſt and good. In truth, To ſay that we have power in and of our ſelves, to do all that God requires of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if our duty is to be meaſured by our power, it will appear that ſinners hardened by continuance in ſin, and profligate wickedneſs, are moſt excuſable; ſeeing they have leaſt power to obey God (as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will confeſs) and ſo by his argument it were unjuſt with God to require that of them, which he doth of others not immerſt in their debaucheries. Yea let me add this alſo; from Dr. <hi>O.</hi> p. 245. of his <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>In the tranſactions between God and the Souls of men, with reſpect unto their obedience and ſalvation, there is none of them but hath a power in ſundry things, as to ſome degrees and meaſures of ohem, to comply with his mind and will, which they voluntarily neglect; And this of its ſelf is ſufficient to bear the charge of their Eternal ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing whereby he endeavours to prove his opinion, p. 25. is, <hi>Becauſe God blames thoſe under all his miniſtrations, that did not or do not ſuitably obey him therein:</hi> To which he adds in the third place, <hi>He threatens and executes Judgement on all ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe depend on the firſt; and no man beſides Mr <hi>C.</hi> would have made uſe of them as diſtinct <hi>mediums</hi> in the proof of his poſition.</p>
            <p>The firſt therefore being enervated, theſe fall with it. But he ſaith, If we accept not this as a ſufficient proof of his notion.</p>

               <hi>We cannot have right, honourable, and God-like thoughts of the Lord, to require, blame, pity, promiſe, threaten, and execute terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgement on a people, that in no caſe was able to help it.</hi>

            <p>He that can make good ſenſe of theſe words, hath more skill then I, but I heartily wiſh non-ſenſe had been the worſt fault in Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Book, however it be, I will endeavour to give a diſtinct anſwer to that which he drives at. 1. God may require obedience

               </gap>ency that men are under, they cannot, nor they will not obey; but they can and do wilfully refuſe to obey God, and therefore are juſtly blamed and puniſhed for this wickedneſs, and are alſo as Creatures, the object<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of pity while they thus deſtroy themſelves. 3. Promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are fit <hi>mediums</hi> to work upon rational Creatures, who are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding the terms in which the things of the ſpirit of God are propoſed to them (though the Glory of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they diſcern not) and to put forth a free act of their wills in reference to them; as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith himſelf in his <hi>Bod. of Div.</hi> p. 452. <hi>Though man hath loſt the freedom of his will to that which is good by ſinning, yet not the power of willing.</hi> And 4. By the mighty power of Gods ſpirit giving efficacy to this means, the Elect are made obedient, and the reſt left without excuſe or Cloak for their ſin.</p>
            <p>As for that clauſe, <hi>That in no caſe was able to help it:</hi> it is falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. They act ſpontaneouſly, and are in no caſe willing to help it, whoſe Souls are not renewed by ſpecial Grace. He goes on, p. 26.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It muſt be ſo becauſe the contrary leaves the condemnation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at Gods door, which f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The things before pleaded, do fully remove out of our way what is here offered: But farther to detect his aequivocation; mind, 1. Although it be impoſſible for dead ſinners to quicken themſelves; yet ſeeing this impoſſibility is founded in the corruption of their natures, and wickedneſs of their own hearts, it cannot in the leaſt excuſe their diſobedience. 2. Sinners are liable to damnation for the breach of the Law, and if they add hereunto diſobedience to the Goſpel, it neceſſarily aggravates their ſin and condemnation; and this they will do, if left to themſelves; but neither doth this neceſſity, which is only a neceſſity of infallibility, with reſpect to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105700:43"/> the event, in any wiſe infringe their liberty, or excuſe their ſin. 3. Whereas he talketh of unbelief <hi>that comes ſimply from the debility and impotency of men, and the debility of the means afforded them:</hi> and in the next Section, <hi>Of that which befalls a man that, he could not, nor in any caſe cannot help,</hi> &amp;c. I muſt tell him, that it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly done to repreſent this, as the opinion of the men with whom his controverſie is; ſeeing they teach, That mens diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God ſprings from their obſtinacy, and not only impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and they are condemned for that, and not <hi>ſimply</hi> for this alone, and alſo, That the means of Salvation tendred in the Goſpel, is full and gloriouſly perfect in its kind: But the reaſon why the Goſpel is not effectual to the ſalvation of all that hear it is, The natural enmity and obſtinacy of their hearts againſt God is ſuch, that unleſs it be overcome and cured, by him that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, they do finally reſiſt the call of God, and will not come to Chriſt that they might have life: And this defilement of humane nature man brought upon himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y his fall, which he could have helped and prevented if he would, and it is approved and delighted in by all his poſterity. 4. The falſhood therefore of his ſaying, <hi>That is no mans ſin not to do what he cannot do,</hi> is evident, ſeeing mans duty is determined by Gods holy command, not his own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful weakneſs. So then our Doctrine doth not lay the ſin of men at Gods door (as he ſuggeſts) but at their own, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lays it; It ſpoileth man indeed of all matter of boaſting, which is the true reaſon of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> endeavour to load it with this calumny.</p>

            <p>I return to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> who will now give us inſtances to illuſtrate his former aſſertion, and (that he may take this opportunity, to let out more of his poiſonous Doctrine) chiefly inſiſts on original ſin, which he endeavours to perſwade men is an harmleſs thing, and of it ſelf lays them under no more guilt, then doth a fit of ſickneſs, or any other affliction of the like kind, that no man can help, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only thus much he grants,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its true the firſt death is come on all men by</hi> Adams <hi>tranſgreſſion, they having the ſame original nature of ſin and death, its come into all men as a Judgement for the firſt tranſgreſſion, but not as a ſin to the ſecond death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although it may not be eaſie to find out any good ſenſe of theſe words [the Original nature of ſin and death] yet it is eaſie to underſtand what is the drift of his diſcourſe, which he alſo farther explains anon, and which I before touched: And therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him, before I examine what he ſaith, I will briefly propoſe the truth concerning this point as it is taught in the Scriptures <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and other places, <hi>viz. Job 14. 4. Pſal. 51. 5. Joh. 3. 6. &amp;c.</hi> From whence I gather,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Adam</hi> in his primitive ſtate was to be conſidered as a publick perſon, in whom all mankind (that in an ordinary way of generation came of him) were; and in whom they ſinned and fell, when he fell: And they are to be conſidered in him legally and naturally: 1. Legally as he was (according to the terms of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105700:44"/> the Covenant in which he ſtood related to God) their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and ſo received his perfections, or original righteouſneſs, for them as well as for himſelf, and they as well as he loſt it by the fall. 2. Naturally, as he was the root of all mankind, which were vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in his Loins when he fell: So then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Original ſin is either Imputed or Inherent. The imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin to his poſterity, by which they are moſt juſtly accounted to have ſinned in him, who was the root, and both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and faederal principle of mankind, is in ſome ſort the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe of the inherent pravity of the humane nature deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, which is diffuſed through all the parts of the Soul, and is a juſt puniſhment for the firſt offence; by which we are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away from God, and diſpoſed to all wickedneſs, it being the root, ſeed and principle of all actual tranſgreſſions and ſins; and is therefore ſo frequently by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>ſin</hi> in a way of emphaſis; <hi>and the fleſh;</hi> of which all the abominations that are in the world are the proper fruit and off-ſpring, and are ſo repreſented by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8 &amp;c. <hi>ch. 13. 14. Gal. 5. 19. Col. 2. 11. Eph.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When therefore we affirm with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. That by the offence of one, Judgement came upon all men unto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; neither doth the holy Ghoſt in that Text, nor we, intend to aſſert, that any are actually damned for <hi>Adams</hi> particular fact: but, That by his ſin and our ſinning in him, by Gods moſt juſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, we have loſt original righteouſneſs, and ſo (as darkneſs neceſſarily is, where light is taken away or denied, and ſickneſs where health is not) contracted that exceeding pravity and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of nature, which deſerveth the curſe of God and Eternal damnation; and it is inherent uncleanneſs that actually excludes out of the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, it is eaſie to gather how pernicious Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s doctrine is, who teacheth, that Original ſin expoſeth only to temporal or bodily, not Eternal death. The Apoſtle conſtantly affirms <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. that it is the death and condemnation, that Chriſt ſaveth his people from, (which ſurely is the ſecond, not the firſt death only) which by our fall in <hi>Adam</hi> we were expoſed to, and guilty of.</p>
            <p>But why doth not Original ſin deſerve the ſecond death? Is it becauſe <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion was but trivial, certainly the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of his ſin were exceeding great, There was contempt of God, diſ-belief of his word, pride, breach of Covenant, Theft,

            <p>Original ſin may be conſidered either in the unregenerate in whom it reigns, and is wholly unmortified; or as remaining in the regenerate, though mortified and ſpoiled of its reigning power; The unregenerate are under the power thereof in all the faculties of their Souls; It is blindneſs and vanity in their minds; hatred of God, and obſtinacy in their wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they are content to be commanded by this principle, and the firſt moral acting of the Soul is influenced thereby, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58. 3. and in them the luſtings of the fleſh are never reſiſted, from any true hatred of their ſinfulneſs; though on other accounts, as they are apprehended deſtructive to themſelves one way or other, they may be ſo, in ſome particular actings thereof. But in the regenerate there is a contrary principle, even the Law of the Spirit of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus that ſets them free from the Law of ſin and death, ſo that they obey not the fleſh in the Luſts thereof; and theſe, as they are by the power of the ſpirit of Grace delivered from the ſervice of ſin, ſo are they alſo by the efficacy of Chriſts bloud ſaved from the condemning power thereof: <hi>There is no condemnation to them, Rom.</hi> 8. 1.

            <p>As for <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. The evident ſcope of the Apoſtle is, not to teach men to juſtifie the wicked luſtings of their hearts, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> doth; but to prove that the ſpring of all the wickedneſs of man, is in his own Breaſt, and it will be in vain for him to think of ſhifting off the blame to any other.

            <p>As to that which he adds concerning Infants and Idiots; To ſuppoſe them no way concerned in ſin as he doth, and ſo well enough without Chriſt, is like the reſt of his Doctrine: This I ſay, becauſe the Scripture ſaith it, which declares all to be under ſin

            <p>The <hi>5th</hi> thing he inſiſts on to prove his opinion, is Gods expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulating with men to convince them of the equality of his ways: That the ways of God towards the Sons of men are full of Equity and Grace; is evident from what I have already proved in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his errours; and to his harangue about it, I ſhall only ſay: There is no need for him to ſpeak wickedly for God: His righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is abundantly manifeſted by the light of Scripture Doctrine, without the help of his notions, and ſhall be yet farther manifeſted in the day of Chriſt, to the ſhame and ſilencing of all that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply againſt God, even in thoſe things where his Judgements are a great deep: as the Apoſtle diſcourſeth at large <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and 11.

            <p>Two things he here takes for granted, but both without ground.</p>
            <p>1. That all the World are under the Covenant of Grace, ſo as to be preſently intereſted in the priviledges thereof; and accepted in thoſe ſincere endeavours to obey God, which they are capable of in that condition wherein they are by nature, which is not ſo; For all that can be ſaid of Men in General unto whom the Goſpel is preached, amounts to no more then this, That the Grace and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105700:47"/> Bleſſings of the New covenant are offered to them upon condition of Faith: God declareth his good pleaſure to ſinners, that if they or any of them do confeſs and forſake their ſins, <hi>they ſhall find mercy;</hi> and thoſe of them that do believe, he gives the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> unto, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. and they are under Grace <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.

            <p n="1">1. It is not a <hi>moral ſinful impetency or deficiency,</hi> that the Apoſtle there ſpeaks of: but only a want of riches, and ability in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to contribute ſo largely to the neceſſity of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thoſe Texts which he endeavours to wreſt in the beginning of this Chapter, have been already vindicated from his corrupt gloſſes, I do therefore here paſs them over, and attend to what he ſaith, p. 31. where he propounds this queſtion,</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105700:48"/> ſo far from this proud conceit of himſelf, that he confeſſeth the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>That we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> i. e. It is of God in a way of Grace, who works all our works in us. But againſt the ſaying of the Apoſtle, he excepts p. 43.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its true as of our ſelves only we are not, diſtinct from Chriſt and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Grace we are not; but by the helps afforded there is power both to will and to do the will of God in the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems by theſe words of <hi>Tho.

               <hi>ſufficient</hi> or <hi>meet</hi> for it; any way capable of our ſelves to exert, or frame a good thought in our own Breaſts: and this he denies of himſelf when converted, and refers all the praiſe of the exerciſe of Grace in his Soul to the ſpirit of God even then; now it is leſs to think then to will, and leſs to will then to perform: And if our ability for the former be denied, it muſt be ſo much more for the latter: And if it be denied of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted man, much more of one unconverted: It is repugnant to reaſon and Scripture evidence to think, that the bleſſed Apoſtle, a perſon in all reſpects qualified with natural endowments and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yea in an eminent manner aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, ſhould ſay that he had no ſufficiency of his own, for any thing that was truly good; and in the mean while to ſuppoſe that any uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

            <p>In p. 32. he farther opens his mind about converſion and tells us, <hi>If God did not work at all by his ſpirit, but only give the Goſpel which hath in its ſelf a natural tendency to draw ſinners to Chriſt, if according to their capacities they believe and obey it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhould undoubtedly be ſaved.</hi>

            <p>But if we conſult the holy Scriptures, we ſhall find that in them converſion is ſpoken of in a Dialect far differing from Mr. <hi>Colliers.</hi> For inſtance <hi>Jam. 1. 18.

So alſo conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is called <hi>a new Creation,</hi> and Grace <hi>the new man,</hi> or a <hi>new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. Eph. 4. 24. &amp; 2. 10. which terms in the common ſenſe of men, ſignifie the production of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not in being, by a divine power, even the ſame that wrought in Chriſt, when he was raiſed from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. and do not ſuppoſe any pre-diſpoſition or inclination in the perſon where this new Creation is not, exciting the great Creator to a concurrence or aſſiſtance in order to its production. Yet Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> hath the boldneſs to ſay, that all theſe expreſſions amount to no more (if rightly weighed) then what he hath aſſerted, <hi>viz. That God doth help men to believe, by the working of his ſpirit with them; ſo cheriſhing the Good he finds in them that it be not maſtered by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual bruitiſh part.</hi> Greater contempt hath not lightly been caſt upon the holy ſpirit of God, who works all Grace in us; nor upon his ſayings in the Scipture, whereby his operation on the Souls of men is unfolded to us; as if the holy Ghoſt intended to perſwade them, that they are beholding to diſtinguiſhing Grace for that, which in truth they have in nature, and do themſelves.</p>
            <p>The reaſon that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> gives for his talking at this rate, is, <hi>Becauſe its we that believe and obey the Goſpel, and not the Spirit: and its our duty, and ſo ſtated in the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this he intends to prove, that the Spirit of God is not the only and principal efficient cauſe of Faith in men: but they open their own eyes, and raiſe themſelves from the dead, and create themſelves anew in Chriſt Jeſus; or elſe believing muſt be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Spirit, and not to them, and muſt be conſidered as his duty, and not theirs.</p>
            <p>I might tell Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> (ſeeing he pretends to Learning) <hi>Qui actionis cauſa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105700:50"/> its in vain to trouble his head with any Philoſophical notion: I ſhall rather make evident his miſtake, by ſome familiar inſtance that may be within his reach. And I know none fitter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To make the matter more plain we muſt remember, That there are two moments in converſion to be conſidered; The firſt is the infuſion of a principle of Life and Grace, by which the Soul is enabled and diſpoſed to convert and believe, being renewed after the image of God; and this is called <hi>Gratia prima, the firſt Grace,</hi> in the reception whereof we are paſſive. The ſecond is, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this Grace in actual turning to God, believing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through the bleſſed aſſiſtance of the Good ſpirit, who worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h in us to do as well as to will: and this is called <hi>Gratia ſecunda;</hi> In this the Soul is active, and works according to the working of him who works in it mightily.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs farther, I think it may be a convenient place here to remove out of our way, the corrupt gloſſes of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> upon a Text or two, which he is pleaſed to take notice of towards the end of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. mentioned by him p. 39. The words are, <hi>without me ye can do nothing.</hi> The deſign of Chriſt in theſe words, is to preſs his Diſciples to abide in him; for this end he tells them in this Verſe, I <hi>am the vine, ye are the branches; he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat abideth in me and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; for without me</hi> (or, ſevered from me <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are by nature dry branches, and unfruitful, meet fuel for the fire of Gods wrath; and if ever we bring forth fruit to God, we muſt firſt by the powerful Grace of God the great Husband-man, be ingraffed into Chriſt the true Vine; that we may derive Life and Grace from him: neither will our admiſſion into the Church ſuffice thereunto, without real union with himſelf, and cleaving to him by faith lively and unfeigned, by the daily exerciſe whereof we fetch new ſupplies of Grace, ſo drawing ſap, from him, from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105700:50"/> whom our fruit is found: Thus is he unto us as the Vine unto the Branches; for without Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> the influence of his Aid and Grace, or in a ſtate of ſeparation, in which we are not capable of this vital influence from him, we can do nothing; underſtand it according to the ſubject matter, nothing that is ſpiritually Good. Surely this caſts man down from that Throne of ſelf-ſufficiency, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> would advance him; and very poorly doth he acquit himſelf in his reply thereto; He ſaith:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All the common light, underſtanding and reaſon that men have is from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the refuge of the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lagians</hi> of Old, in which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath before attempted to ſhelter himſelf: They would pretend to own the Grace of God, when their meaning was no more then this, <hi>That men as men, were beholding to God for their natural accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> more then which they neither had, nor needed from him, to enable them to yield acceptable obedience to him: but that ſomething elſe is intended in this Text, we have already mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Goſpel leads Souls to him, where their help is; Its that which I ſay there is no capacity or power without the Goſpel, which unites Souls to Chriſt in whom their Life is,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is the Faith of the Goſpel, and not the bare hearing of it that unites the Soul to Chriſt; and though Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> here tell us of drawing to Chriſt, and Union with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet his deſign is ſtill to exclude the ſpecial and effectual work of the ſpirit, to bring the Soul to Chriſt, and preſerve it in him, which I before proved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary hereunto. And there is little heed to be taken to his ſaying, <hi>There is no power or capacity without the Goſpel:</hi> this is but to ſerve a preſent turn; for he hath in his foregoing Chapters pleaded, <hi>That where the Goſpel never comes, men have ſufficient means and power to live to God without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Text is 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Who maketh thee to differ, and what haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> So Mr. <hi>C.</hi> reads it, p. 43, about which we need not contend: add thereunto the cloſe of the verſe; <hi>now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> From hence we may ſafely infer, That if any man differ from another, or from what he was in himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that is to ſay, be raiſed from a ſtate of death in ſins and treſpaſſes, unto newneſs of life; delivered from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of the Son of Gods love;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105700:51"/> it is God hath made this difference, to the praiſe of the riches of his Grace. And thus much Mr. <hi>C.</hi> in anſwer to the objection grants, <hi>It is God by Goſpel Grace makes us to diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> But if Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notion elſewhere be true, that <hi>amongſt men that receive every way as much Grace from God the one as the other, ſome believe unto life, others remain in their ſins;</hi> it will neceſſarily follow, that thoſe of them which chooſe the better part, do make themſelves to differ, and have cauſe of boaſting, if not before God, yet in compariſon with other men; And this is in terms denied by the Apoſtle; And Mr. <hi>C.</hi> makes no reply thereto, but what hath now been oft men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and anſwered; and therefore I will not trouble the Reader with a repetition of it.</p>
            <p>The Text that remains to be inſiſted on, is <hi>Phil. 2. 13. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do; of his g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Doctrine, is evident. In the foregoing Verſe he exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>work out their own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> By <hi>working out their Salvation;</hi> he intends labouring for, or beſtowing their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt induſtry to obtain Salvation: and according to this ſenſe is the ſame word rendred, <hi>Joh. 6. 27. Labour not for the meat that periſheth,</hi> &amp;c. Now hereunto two things are required: 1. A prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple enabling and diſpoſing them to walk humbly with God in Faith and Obedience. 2. The exerciſe thereof,<note place="margin">

And as we have before proved, that Grace is wrought in us by the ſpirit of God; ſo the Apoſtle here expreſly affirms, that both to will and to do (which expreſſions take in the whole of its exerciſe) is alſo effectually wrought in us by him, <hi>of his own good pleaſure:</hi> which is the moſt prevailing argument and motive to an humble walking with God, and encouragement thereto.</p>
            <p>He that reads Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Gloſs upon this Text, p. 43. will find him conſtrained almoſt to embrace that notion of it that doth evert his opinion: and all that he offers towards the ſalving of it, is in theſe words; <hi>To underſtand it to intend Gods working an impulſive will, and that they could not, or ſhould not work without it, deſtroys the exhortation, and makes null the duty.</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105700:51"/> And it hath been already manifeſted to be his great errour to conceive, That nothing is required of us in a way of duty, but what in our lapſed ſtate we are able to perform without the help of Gods ſpirit. And therefore it is fallaciouſly done of him, to join thoſe terms together, as if they were of equal extent; that they could not, or ſhould not work without it: It was their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible duty to obey the exhortation foregoing; but this they could not do without the effectual working of God in them. And there is not more frequent mention of any one thing in the Goſpel (it being that wherein Goſpel Grace doth eminently ſhine forth) then of our receiving Grace from God to enable us to yield to him that Obedience which he requires of us.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pious therefore and well grounded was the petition of that worthy oppoſer of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of Old: <hi>Da Domine quod jubes; &amp; jube quod vis: Give me O Lord what thou requireſt of me, and command what thou pleaſeſt.</hi> Indeed to deny that we receive any thing from god in a way of ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing Grace, that is required of us in a way of duty, is flatly to reject the Goſpel, and to deny the Grace of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. We do not then deſtroy the exhortation, and make null the duty; but inſtruct men which way they may expect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace to obey it in the performance of their duty; which is certainly a great quickening and incouragement thereto, unto all that have an humble ſenſe of their concernment in theſe things.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now return to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> p. 34. where he propounds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion.</p>

            <p>Here we have another inſtance of the mans contradiction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as well as unto truth. But to theſe things I ſay,</p>
            <p>It is indeed certain from the Scriptures, that many are convinced, who never are converted by the ſpirit of God; and alſo that the convictions of ſome proceed ſo far, as that they eſcape the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the world through Luſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. paſs under that work deſcribed <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. and yet fail of thoſe things that accompany ſalvation, which are things better then all that was before mentioned.

And probably the thing he drives at in this Queſtion is, whether God doth more for, and the Spirit worketh more powerfully in one of theſe then the other. And firſt he pretends that this is a great ſecret, and God onely knows it, but according to his principles it is eaſily reſolved in the Negative: For although (as the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay) God draws ſome <hi>modo congruo,</hi> and others <hi>modo non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruo.</hi> So that ſome have external and circumſtantial advantages beyond others; yet there is no ſpecifical difference in the drawing it ſelf; both the one and the other is only by way of moral ſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not phyſical operation, objective and external, not ſubjective and internal; and the turning caſt ſtill lies on the will of Man, not the efficacy of Grace. And I marvel that he ſhould pretend ſo much modeſty in this point, who but a little before hath aſſerted, that which all ſober <hi>Arminians</hi> proteſt againſt, <hi>viz. The ſufficiency or ability of man to believe, without any help from the holy Ghoſt.</hi>

And this Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſeems to own as the priviledge of the ſpecial Elect; and without this none ever was, or will be converted.</p>
            <p>In p. 35. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> propoſeth a Queſtion about the fore-knowledge of God, which he ſuppoſeth to be really diſtinct from his Decree; and though he be very unmeet to diſpute ſuch a Queſtion, yet he reſolves to give the poor Calviniſts another laſh, before he finiſh his anſwer to it: Both Queſtion and Anſwer are too confuſed for us to get any good by a particular examination of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead thereof, I will only give a brief account of what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in this matter, and ſo obviate his deſign.</p>
            <p>The Divine knowledge is variouſly diſtinguiſhed, according to its reſpecting different objects; I ſhall at preſent conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Things future are all thoſe things, and only thoſe, which do in time come to paſs. Now whatſoever hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, doth, or ſhall come to paſs in time, was future from Eternity; <hi>i. e.</hi> It was true from Eternity that ſuch things would be, and as things that would be were they known unto God before time. Seeing then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105700:53"/> ſome things were to be, and many things poſſible never ſhall be; it appears that ſome things were from Eternity paſſed from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of things meerly poſſible in which they were equally with others, by their own nature; into a condition of futurition: and there can be no cauſe aſſigned of this migration or paſſage, without God, for there was nothing before time but himſelf; It remains therefore that the cauſe thereof was in God; and indeed it was the will, purpoſe, or decree of God, that ſome things ſhould be, others ſhould not, that alone made this change. So that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of things to be that is in God, ſuppoſeth his Decree that they ſhall be; and in truth, the foreknowledge or Decree of God, conſidered as in him, is the ſame; and the Scripture indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uſeth either term to denote the ſame thing; though we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the imbecility of our underſtanding, form differing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of them; we conceive of the Decree as an act of God, willing that ſuch things ſhould be; and of Divine preſcience as an act of God, foreſeeing or knowing the coming to paſs of the things willed by him.</p>
            <p>Amongſt things future, ſome are good, ſome are evil, <hi>viz. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</hi> Thoſe that are good God decreed to effect; thoſe that are evil, to permit, or ſuffer to be done, knowing how, and having purpoſed in himſelf to order them, and over rule the doing of them for his own glory in the end. Again, ſome things we ſee, are the effects of cauſes that work neceſſarily, <hi>neceſſitate conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi> others of free agents, which are to us wholly contingent; yet do alſo neceſſarily come to paſs, <hi>neceſſitate conſequentiae.</hi> And things are therefore thus effected in time, becauſe God had decreed this order before time. Hence is the certainty of Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (which dependeth not on any thing without himſelf) and ſo a neceſſity as to the event, that whatſoever hath been or ſhall be, ſhould ſo come to paſs as it doth: But this is a neceſſity of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> not of <hi>coaction,</hi> and doth eſtabliſh, not infringe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of free agents.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly apply theſe things to the caſe in hand: It will be granted I ſuppoſe, that the utmoſt end intended by God in all that comes to paſs, is his own glory: He hath made all things for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and in the making of man, God had an eye to the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of his mercy and juſtice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. In order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he purpoſed to create man upright, but mutable; and to permit his temptation and falling by ſin; and to ſave a remnant of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105700:54"/> fallen man-kind, by Jeſus Chriſt, through ſanctification of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and belief of the truth; that his free grace might be everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly glorified in the Veſſels of mercy, which he before prepared untoglory: ſo alſo he purpoſed to leave the reſt in their fallen ſtate, to the wickedneſs of their own hearts, and juſtly to puniſh them for it; therein ſhewing his wrath, and making his power known, on the Veſſels of wrath, which he had endured with much long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, who were fitted for deſtruction. Thus the end of all men is foreknown unto God, and nothing falls out caſually unto him, yet is there no force put upon man, nor injuſtice or hard dealing from God for him to complain of.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſaith p. 36. <hi>It is diſhonourable unto God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to men; and layeth all the wickedneſs and plagues of the world at Gods door, to affirm, as ſome do, That God decreed</hi> Adams <hi>fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made him; or at leaſt ſo far foreknew it, as that it muſt be;</hi> i. e. <hi>ſo as to neceſſitate it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An heavy charge! And we know right well who M. <hi>Collier</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it againſt: But it will be far more eaſie for me to manifeſt, That the men of his controverſie have no concernment in it; then for him to vindicate his own truth and honeſty; inaſmuch as what they hold infers no ſuch thing, as you may ſee by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written of this matter, and whatſoever in his report of their opinion looketh this way, is untruly imputed to them. His beſt plea will be, that he ſlandered them by hearſay, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knew not, nor underſtood what they affirmed of this matter; yet will not this excuſe him. But to the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Himſelf confeſſeth, That God foreknew that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall: I ask then, Could the Almighty have prevented this or not? If he could and yet did not, we conclude, that he willed or decreed <hi>not to prevent it,</hi> (though no ways approving thereof) having determined to raiſe glory to his own name out of it. And if the moſt high decreed to permit it, and ſo from Eternity foreknew it as future, this inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding therefore, the ſin and plagues of the world, lye at the door of rebellious man. And if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> mean by fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing it ſo as to neceſſitate it, ſuch a foreknowledge or decree of God concerning it, as in the execution thereof man ſhould be compelled to ſin, and his fall effected by God; I deteſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> cannot yet conceive of a neceſſity of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility reſpecting the event of things, ariſing from the decree or foreknowledge of God, without a neceſſity of coaction, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoſe that are to act in the accompliſhment of them; I will endeavour to help him by one plain inſtance, <hi>Act. 4. 27, 28. For of a truth againſt thy holy Child Jeſus whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and People of Iſrael, were gathered together for to do, whatſoever thy hand, and thy counſel determined before to be done.</hi> It is evident their deſign was not to fulfill the counſel of God: But thus it fell out; for whatſoever they did to the Lord Jeſus, God had in his counſel determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done; yea had foretold by the mouth of all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that ſo it ſhould be, unto every circumſtance of Chriſts paſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> his Crucifying, having Gall and Vinegar given him to drink, the parting of his Raiment, piercing of his ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now either theſe things muſt ſo come to paſs, or elſe the counſel of God muſt be diſappointed, and his word falſified; will Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> then lay the Murther of Chriſt at Gods door? were not all the agents by whoſe hands theſe things were immediately done, free from coaction, and therefore reſponſible for their wickedneſs, all this notwithſtanding? And to make this yet more clear, I will tranſcribe a few lines from Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in his <hi>Orthod. Ev.</hi> p. 75.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe two propoſioions,</hi> 1. Adam <hi>might not have ſinned. 2. It could not be but that</hi> Adam <hi>would ſin, are both true; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they may ſo ſeem, yet they are not oppoſite one unto the other: not being both of the ſame kind:</hi> Adam <hi>might not have ſinned; is a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick, or ſimple propoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is true of</hi> Adam <hi>in the ſenſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, conſidered as in himſelf. It could not be but that</hi> Adam <hi>would ſin, is a modal, or qualified propoſition; and is true of</hi> Adam <hi>in a ſenſe of compoſition, being conſidered as ſubordinate to the Decree.

            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> goes on to attach another ground, and foundation of the Saints rejoycing in God, who hath promiſed to preſerve them blameleſs unto his Heavenly Kingdom. He propounds this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, p. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May we ſuppoſe that perſons who are regenerate, and born from above, may poſſibly fall from this ſtate of Grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath ſome deſign in thruſting in that word [<hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi>] into his Queſtion: I will therefore explain the term, that he may have no equivocal reſerve to fly to.</p>
            <p>A thing may be ſaid to be poſſible either ſimply, and in its own nature; or poſſible on ſuppoſition of all things to be ſuppoſed with reference to it: In the firſt ſenſe it was poſſible that a bone of Chriſt might have been broken; in the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> on ſuppoſition that God had decreed and foretold the contrary, it was not ſo. The Queſtion in reference to the Saints perſeverance proceeds in the laſt ſenſe, whether ſuppoſing their Election of God, Chriſts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for them and their intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, it is yet poſſible that ſome of them may finally depart from God, and be loſt for ever. And to this I anſwer in the Negative: But he ſaith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scriptures do not ſay they may not; nor that they ſhall certainly obtain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is falſe: The contrary appears from theſe Texts, <hi>Pſal. 125. 1, 2. Iſa. 4. 5. &amp; ch. 54. 8, 9, 10. Jer. 31. 3. &amp; ch. 32. 39, 40. Ezek. 36. 26, 27. Joh.</hi> 6. 39, 40. with <hi>ch. 10. 28, 29. Rom. 8. 29, 30, 38, 39. 1 Theſ. 5. 23, 24. 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4, 5. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 19. with many others. He adds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are to ſuppoſe all Goſpel-believers to be regenerate, and then we may, and muſt ſuppoſe a poſſibility, for the regenerate to fall, or none can fall away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Goſpel-believers I preſume he intends thoſe that are members of the viſible Church of Chriſt; ſuch as profeſs Faith in him, and Obedience to him, and do not at preſent contradict their profeſſion by a contrary practice in the ſight of men, My anſwer is, If we reſpect any particular perſon or perſons among theſe, we are bound
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105700:55"/> to hope ſo of them; becauſe Charity always inclineth to the better part: But if we reſpect the whole bulk of profeſſors together, we are not to believe that they are all regenerate perſons; becauſe the Scripture telleth us, there are fooliſh as well as wiſe Virgins, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, as well as ſincere Believers in the viſible Church, though who they be we know not, till their works diſcover it; and when their Hypocriſie is diſcovered, we are not to think that they once were new Creatures, and are fallen from that ſtate; but the quite contrary, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. So then though many Profeſſors fall away, even ſuch as have paſt under ſome common work of the Spirit; this doth not at all infer, That thoſe who are truly born again, not of corruptible Seed, but incorruptible by the word of God that liveth and abideth for ever; may do ſo in like manner. He proceeds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know nothing ſtated in the Goſpel-law of Grace, as a duty in order to obtain the end, but that perſons may obtain, and be ſuppoſed (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) to fall finally from,</hi> Joh. 15. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Nothing! that's ſtrange! Is not <hi>perſeverance</hi> in Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience required in order to ſalvation, and may perſons perſevere, and fall finally too? The Text cited by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> doth no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his notion, although we allow him to except perſeverance from the duties intended by him; Unto the <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> Verſes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been ſpoken already, by which it appears that they lye directly againſt Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notion of the Creatures ability of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to do any thing that is ſpiritually Good: I ſuppoſe it is the <hi>6th.</hi> Verſe that he promiſeth himſelf ſome relief from; The words are, <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not tell us on what account he thinks this Text may ſerve for a proof of his Doctrine; but probably he thinketh that the words ſuppoſe, That ſuch as for a time truly abide in Chriſt, may afterwards ceaſe to do ſo, and periſh out of him; But there is no ſuch thing intended in them: For this Text (as many other do) ſpeaketh of Profeſſors, according to what their condition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be before men; and ſo all that are members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and have a place therein; are counted branches in Chriſt; ſome of theſe bring forth fruit, by which the ſincerity of their Faith in Chriſt, and the truth of their being ſpiritually uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him is manifeſted; Theſe do not fall away; but he that hath begun a good work in them doth perfect it to the end: <hi>The Father purgeth them that they may bring forth more fruit:</hi> Others of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105700:56"/> theſe branches do not bring forth fruit; which is an evidence that their being in Chriſt is only by profeſſion, for it cannot be that one united to Chriſt by true Faith, and the in-dwelling of his ſpirit; ſhould be without thoſe vital influences from him, is will produce ſome good fruit; theſe do not abide in Chriſt by a lively exerciſe of Faith, and therefore being indeed ſeparate from him, while they appear to be one with him; they can do nothing; but in time of temptation fall away from their profeſſion, and are caſt out as branches, and are withered, and men gather them, and they are caſt into the fire and are burned. And more then this cannot without offering violence to the Text, be inferred from it; which doth not make againſt, but confirm the truth concerning the Saints perſeverance.</p>
            <p>That which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> offers to ſtrengthen his deſired inference is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth hereof will father appear if we conſider,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Goſpel makes no difference, but warns all to take heed of falling; which neceſsarily ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of falling with reſpect to us, without taking that heed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all are warned (and that very frequently) in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to take heed of falling, is granted; and that theſe warnings are ſanctified and made effectual by God for the preſervation of his own Elect from final Apoſtacy, is pleaded: But Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from hence is very impertinent, and argues that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not their Opinion that he hath undertaken to confute: He ſaith, <hi>That in reſpect of us there is a poſſibility of falling, if we do not take heed.</hi> Very true! It is not only poſſible but certain, that thoſe which do not walk humbly, and heedfully with God, nor make any conſcience of ſo doing, may fall away from their profeſſion; But God according to his promiſe will keep his <hi>own</hi> from ſuch a courſe as would ruine them: And this is all which with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we ſay, That God hath promiſed by his effectual Grace to preſerve all his choſen ones, all that truly believe, in a way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs and diligence unto Eternal Life. And therefore that is quite beſides the buſineſs that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> writes, p. 35. <hi>That nothing ſhall be able to make a breach or ſeparation, unleſs we do it our ſelves by ſin;</hi> whereas God hath promiſed to prevent our making this breach, when he ſaith, <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgements and do them,</hi> Ezek. 36. 27. The truth is, if Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will abide by his opinion; he muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105700:56"/> either aſſert, That God never <hi>loved any perſon,</hi> one or other; or that he is like us, <hi>changeable</hi> in his love on <hi>outward external reaſons.</hi> He goes on p. 36.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They have all (he intends all in the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt) the ſame faith and love for kind: there is but one faith which hath the ſame object, and is influenced by the ſame ſpirit, which produceth the ſame effect,</hi> i. e. <hi>a good Conſcience, even in ſuch as fall from it.</hi> And in the beginning of p. 37. he adds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that according to the Law of Grace, all that do believe and obey the Goſpel, ſtand related to God therein, and nothing makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but ſincerity and perſeverance ſhall be crowned, and Hypocrites and Back ſliders, muſt fall ſhort, and meet with condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well done of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to join Sincerity and Perſeverance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo alſo Hypocriſie and Back-ſliding, for the latter is a certain diſcovery of the former. <hi>If ye continue in my words</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>then are ye my Diſciples indeed:</hi> And ſo <hi>ê contra.</hi> But then ſee what confuſion he hath again caſt himſelf into; He affirmeth there is in all the ſame faith and love for kind, and nothing to make a difference between them, the ſame effect produced by the ſame ſpirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet ſome are ſincere, others Hypocrites: It is ſtrange that Mr <hi>C.</hi> can find out no ſpecifical difference, betwixt the lively faith of a ſincere believer, and the dead faith of a painted Impoſtor; the moſt holy and precious Faith of Gods Elect, which purifieth the heart, and the temporary feigned Faith of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> notwithſtanding which he was in the gall of bitterneſs and the bond of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>The Text which he inſinuates a perverſion of, is 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 19. Holding faith and a good Conſcience, which ſome having put away, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith have made ſhipwrack.</hi> By Faith here, as in ſome other places, we are to underſtand the Doctrine of Faith, the truth of the Goſpel; which we are exhorted to cleave to, and hold faſt, and that we may do ſo, we muſt keep a good conſcience alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> walk in holineſs; for where that is not attended, men are not like to abide ſound in the Faith, in an hour of temptation; The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Faith muſt be held in a pure conſcience: <hi>which ſome having put away,</hi> that is, rejected, and lived in the neglect of; <hi>concerning Faith have made ſhipwrack;</hi> that is, have loſt and relinquiſhed, that truth which once they profeſſed: of ſuch he gives an inſtance in the following Verſe; But this notwithſtanding; <hi>The foundation of the Lord ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:105700:57"/> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 2. 18, 19. Here then is no ſuch thing ſuppoſed as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> intimates, That thoſe who once had true faith, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, did finally fall from it.</p>

            <p>In p. 37. He moves a queſtion about the abſolute and incondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſes of the new Covenant; where he again pitifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangles himſelf. It might help him a little out of the Labyrinth he is loſt in, if he would conſider,</p>
            <p>That the New Covenant is originally made with Chriſt, who became a ſponſor, and ſurety for all that the Father gave unto him, <hi>Pſal. 89. 31. &amp;c.</hi> and in him all the promiſes thereof are yea and amen; God the Father promiſed unto Chriſt Eternal Life for all his before the world was, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. and engaged in time effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to draw, and bring them unto him, to give them a new heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for whom he became ſurety, that they might not fail to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it on Goſpel terms: And this truth will of it ſelf bear down all Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notions of free will, and falling from Grace: It is granted that all the promiſes of Life and Glory in the Goſpel, are conditional as ſet before us; But the fulfilling of the condition in the Elect is abſolutely undertaken for in the Covenant betwixt the Father and Chriſt. And whereas Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſaith <hi>That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the perfection thereof, when we are come to Glory, will be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in all its promiſes; its abſolutely true to all over-comers;</hi> he lamentably diſcovers his weakneſs thereby: For our preſent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is after thoſe promiſes that do ſecure the Saints ſafe arrival in Glory, and to talk of the abſoluteneſs of theſe promiſes to thoſe that are already glorified, and to repreſent them as uncertain to thoſe that alone are concerned to draw comfort from them, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abſurd.</p>
            <p>In p 38. he frames this Objection againſt himſelf;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This aſſerts a poſſibility of falling from Grace, and ſo deſtroys the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and comfort of Believers:</hi> Unto this he anſwers,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It doth no other then the Scripture doth: its that of which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is full: it frequently preſents us with a poſſibility of falling: Elſe thoſe many and frequent exhortations to the contrary are uſeleſs, if there were no danger, as alſo the examples of thoſe that have fallen,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 19, 20. 2 Tim. 1. 15. Heb. 4. 11. <hi>Elſe what means the Lords appointing a Miniſtry in the Church to preſerve it from falling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Scripture aſſerts no ſuch thing, but the contrary, we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105700:58"/> have manifeſted already; as alſo what the import of theſe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their uſefulneſs in Gods hand for the preſervation of the Elect. We ſay moreover, if we reſpect our own weakneſs, and the temptations we are to conflict with, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>anger, but free Grace will ſecure the Elect from periſhing in the midſt of their dangers, and from being overcome by all the difficulties that are in their way. And it is ſtrange to me that he ſhould conclude true Believers may fall away, becauſe God hath provided means, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Miniſtry, to prevent their falling.</p>
            <p>To the other branch of the Objection, reſpecting the comfort and aſſurance of Believers, he ſaith;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its ſo far from diminiſhing the conſolation of Believers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To that which he adds in the beginning of p. 39. concerning the uſefulneſs of fear; I anſwer; The fear that ariſeth from Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Doctrine hath <hi>torment</hi> in it, and therefore a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the love of God will caſt it out, and teach the Soul to reject that Doctrine from whence it ſprings: That is the true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-fear, which reſpect God as a Father, and is temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, There is (as Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>Saints Perſever.</hi> p. 293.) a twofold fear of Eternal death and deſtruction: 1. An <hi>anxious perplexing fear</hi> in reſpect of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105700:58"/> 
               <hi>end</hi> it ſelf: 2. A <hi>watchful careful fear</hi> in reſpect of the means lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto: The firſt is directly oppoſite to that peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, that God is pleaſed to afford unto his People, and exhorts them to live up to; and therefore it cannot be his end or deſign to ingenerate it in them by any of his threatnings, or warnings given in his word. For the other, <hi>viz.</hi> A watchful heedful fear, for the avoiding of the way and means that would lead them, and do lead others to deſtruction, it is not in the leaſt inconſiſtent with that aſſurance that God is pleaſed by his promiſes to give to his Saints of their perſeverance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now haſten to a cloſe of this Chapter; after I have in a word or two cleared the ſenſe of two Texts of holy Scripture, which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath endeavoured to darken, becauſe they ſpeak not according to his mind.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16-22. After Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath for a while la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured againſt the ſtream of this Text, he is forced p. 40. to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth, <hi>viz That it is not our willing and running, that can bring us within the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpaſs of ſpecial Electing Grace; that being paſt in Gods will before the world was.</hi> Indeed the deſign of the Apoſtle throughout this Chapter, as well as in the Verſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, is to ſhew the freeneſs of Gods grace to his own Elect, together with his juſt ſeverity againſt the veſſels of wrath; and that one is a veſſel of mercy, and another of wrath, proceeds from the meer good pleaſure of God to chooſe the one and leave the other; his choice not being grounded on foreſight of their <hi>willing</hi> or <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> faith and obedience, but being purely reſolved into his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Grace.</p>
            <p>And this doth quite overthrow Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Election on fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of Faith; and doth alſo afford a very good argument for the Saints perſeverance, which we were laſt upon: But I muſt haſten; only it is neceſſary I ſhould remove an abuſive paſſage or two (of which his Book is full) out of our way:</p>
            <p>He ſaith, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And again p. 41. he intimates that his opponents infer from this Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God will damn whom he pleaſe from his own will and power, and ſave whom he will from his own will and power: Let men believe or obey, do what they will or can its all nothing; But that after all

            </p>
            <p>This is as notorious a ſlander, as he could well have caſt upon them; for all they ſay, amounts to no more then this, <hi>That the Election have obtained, and the reſt are blinded:</hi> And this we are bold to affirm ſtill, having ſo good warranty for it as we have, though he go on to reproach us therefore. But that we ſay, <hi>willing and running, believing and obeying, &amp;c. is in vain to the non-Elect, and that after all watching and warring, the ſtate of men muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Eternal will and power,</hi> is a very groſs, and I fear a ſtudied untruth, there being no foot-ſteps of any ſuch aſſertion to be found in the Doctrine or Writings of the men of his controverſie. It being conſtantly aſſerted by them, That there is an inſeparable connexion between Faith and Salvation, and that it is an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth, That <hi>he which believeth ſhall be ſaved. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d he which believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> and it is as true; That none do will or run after a right manner but the Elect, who are drawn with loving kindneſs, becauſe loved with an Everlaſting love. It is in vain for Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to pretend to be a follower of peace and holineſs, whilſt he makes no conſcience of belying and abuſing thoſe, that have no otherwiſe offended him, then by a ſober aſſerting of thoſe truths, that the corruption of his heart riſeth againſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith p. 40. <hi>That it condemns all willing and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without having reſpect to the mercy of God in the Goſpel, leaving out Chriſt, and Grace, &amp;c.</hi> This is a truth in it ſelf, though not the direct ſenſe of this Text, That all ſuch running will be in vain. But I deſire to know how he will reconcile this with his other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of the Salvation of very many that know not Chriſt, nor the Grace of God as revealed in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The other Text is 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 19. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out that they might be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that they were not all of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Text is ſo expreſs againſt the falling away of true Believers, that Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> deſpairs of dealing with it, on any<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Add. word,</hi> p. 44.</note> fair terms; and therefore inſtead of an Expoſition, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures upon a down-right contradiction to it. The Apoſtle ſaith, That by perſons going out from the true Church, it is manifeſt they never were living members of it; and that God ſuffers ſuch to fall away, that ſo their Hypocriſie might be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.

            <argument>
               <p>Of Juſtification.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat Article of our Faith which concerns the Juſtification of a ſinner in the ſight of God, muſt needs be acknowledged to be of great importance, and we ought to be more careful of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then that our minds be not corrupted from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and we moved from our ſted faſtneſs thereabout; and therefore although Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> in the Book before me hath ſaid but little directly to that point, yet obſerving divers things therein very oppoſite to, and inconſiſtent with the truth in this matter, I could not paſs them without ſome remark.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place I ſhall briefly propoſe what the Scripture teacheth us, and then examine Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notions that are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth revealed therein.</p>
            <p>The term Juſtification is conſtantly in the Scriptures ſpeaking of this matter taken in a Law-ſenſe, as it imports the acquitting of a perſon by the ſentence of a Judge; The Juſtification of a ſinner by God, is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The gracious ſentence of God by which for Chriſts ſake apprehended by Faith, he loooſeth the ſinner from his Obligation to Eternal wrath and puniſhment; and accounts him righteous to the obtai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing of Life and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the ſentence of God as a Judge acquitting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a gracious ſentence without any reſpect to our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or works of Righteouſneſs that we have done or can do, <hi>Rom. 3. 24. Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The meritorious cauſe of our Juſtification is the Obedience of Chriſt both paſſive and active; and our actual<note place="margin">Voet. Select. Diſput. pars 5. p. 281.</note> Juſtification is the effect or conſequent of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation thereof unto us. Juſtification in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon thereof, doth ſpeak two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A diſcharge from condemnation; or, the remiſſion of ſins; which was purchaſed by the death and blood-ſhedding of Chriſt; <hi>Gal. 3. 13. Eph.</hi> 1. 7. The benefit of which purchaſe r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dounds to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105700:60"/> us, becauſe of Gods reckoning upon our account, or imputing to us what our ſurety ſuffered in our ſtead, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The adjudging of us to be Heirs of, and ſo inrighting us in, Life and Glory, for the ſake of Chriſts active Obedience imputed to us in like manner, <hi>Rom. 3. 22. ch.</hi> 4. 4, 5. &amp; 5. 19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. True and lively Faith whereby we receive Chriſt and his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits freely given of God to us, and reſt on him and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the inſtrument of our Juſtification, <hi>Joh. 1. 12. Rom.</hi> 5. 17. So that Faith alone juſtifieth (though juſtifying Faith is never alone, but worketh by love) and that Righteouſneſs for the ſake of which we are juſtified before God, was wrought out and fulfilled only by Chriſt; who was made ſin for us, although he knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him. And therefore in the buſineſs of Juſtification, Faith is oppoſed to all good works, as excluſive of them from any influence into the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of our pardon and acceptance with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 21, 22. &amp; <hi>v. 28. chap. 4. 4, 5. Gal. 2. 16. ch.</hi> 3. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>The firſt mention of this Article, that I meet with in Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Book is <hi>ch. 1. p.</hi> 12. where after ſome boaſting of his clear ſtating the matter in his <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> he thus writes,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any perſons dare to maintain, that any are juſtified before God without Faith and Holineſs as the terms thereof, though not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving cauſe; I muſt leave them to their own underſtanding without all Scripture grounds; for my own part I fully, on good grounds, believe the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> ſwelling words of vanity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the underſtanding of others; I muſt tell him, even theſe words are not ſo clear and ſcriptural, but that they give juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuſpect his own underſtanding to be dark, and his judgement to be unſound. For although true and juſtifying Faith is pregnant with good works, and whoſoever is juſtified is ſanctified alſo; and that Faith conſidered as a Grace inherent in us, belongs to our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: yet doth not the Scripture any where allow good works the ſame influence into our Juſtification as it doth unto Faith; which is a clear evidence that it is not the act of believing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r any other holy duty for which we are juſtified: but that in this buſineſs, Faith is to be conſidere as relative to Chriſt, and that it is the object of Faith apprehended thereby on the account of which its ſaid to juſtifie. And this Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> cannot but own, if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105700:61"/> what is aſſerted by himſelf in his <hi>Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Div.</hi> concerning the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs unto us in order to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God; For if we are juſtified freely by Grace, and are preſented without ſpot before God in an imputed Righteouſneſs, then can our good works have no intereſt in the reaſon of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him. And indeed if this were not ſo, we could not be juſtified at all, foraſmuch as the <hi>Lord is of purer eye: then to behold iniquity;</hi> and our ſanctification is imperfect, ſo that if all our Righteouſneſſes, ſo far forth as ours be examined in ſtrictneſs of juſtice, they will be found but filthy raggs, a Covering too narrow, and a Bed too ſhort. Yea if thoſe that plead moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the intereſt of good works in our Juſtification, would ſeriouſly conſider what themſelves dare abide by before the tremendous tribunal of the great Judge; they muſt all fly to <hi>Bellarmines tutiſſimum eſt,</hi> and put an end to this controverſie, by acknowledging that they dare not venture into Gods ſight, nor paſs out of the World to his Judgement-ſeat in their own Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But indeed there is another principle laid down once and again by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> in thoſe Chapters of his Book already examined, which (if true) renders all diſcourſes of deliverance from wrath to come by Chriſt needleſs, and without ground; It is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the penalty of the breach of the firſt Covenant, was only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death, and Eternal damnation is inflicted on men only for ſinning againſt the Goſpel, the Law of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this were true, Beſides that in ſome reſpects it renders the condition of thoſe that never heard of Chriſt more eligible then thoſe who live under the ſound of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be no Law threatning Eternal death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ferg.</hi> Differ. of Moral Virtue &amp; Grace, p. 107.</note> but the Law of Faith, then there is no ſuch thing as forgiveneſs and remiſſion of ſin in the World; For the Goſpel denounceth damnation only againſt final impenitency and unbelief; and as theſe are not pardoned nor pardonable, ſo on the other hand, if there be no Law threatning Eternal death beſides the Goſpel, then is there no other ſin we need forgiveneſs of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this be true, Then Chriſt never dyed to free any from wrath to come (which yet is plentifully aſſerted in the Scriptures; wherein we read alſo that his death was for the Redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15.) For it is non-ſenſe to ſay that he hath freed us from the curſe of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105700:61"/> the Goſpel; yea it is a repugnancy, unleſs you will introduce ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel to relieve againſt the terms of this, nor will that ſerve the turn, unleſs you likewiſe find another Mediator to out-merit this. Thus Mr. <hi>Ferguſon,</hi> in anſwer to one of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> mind.</p>
            <p>So then if Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will abide by this notion, and the juſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof, his ſenſe of our Juſtification muſt either be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to himſelf, or elſe very corrupt and unſound.</p>
            <p>Another paſſage that hath a bad aſpect this way, you meet with <hi>Addit. Word,</hi> p. 50. where he gives this reaſon why his ſuppoſed deliverance of the damned will not extend to any degree of Glory, but only a deliverance from pain and miſery, <hi>For they are under no promiſe of reward of Good works, becauſe they had none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God will graciouſly reward the good works of Believers, is granted, ſo that beſides that joy and glory that all Saints have an immediate right to by virtue of their intereſt in Chriſt, every one ſhall receive a ſuperadded Crown, according as his work ſhall be; which layeth a foundation for our believing the enjoyment of different degrees of Glory among the bleſſed in another world. But to ſuppoſe, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> here doth, That the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of perſons into the Kingdom of God is for the ſake of their own good works, is contrary to the whole current of Scripture, and cannot conſiſt with a ſound Judgement concerning our Juſtification; but neceſſarily leads to a Popiſh or <hi>Socinian</hi> notion thereof. I cannot ſee what good works the Thief upon the Croſs had to procure his admiſſion into the Kingdom of God; yet he being freely juſtified by Grace, went immediately from the Croſs to Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>To conclude this; no leſs offenſive is that paſſage we meet with, p. 59.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Proteſtants to be rid of Popiſh meritorious works, run themſelves too much in both principle and practice, beyond almoſt all works of Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hath a long time been the clamour of the Jeſuites againſt the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel; and for Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> joyning with them in this calumny and ſlander (of which neither he nor they can ever make proof, at leaſt ſo far as concerns their Doctrine) there is no reaſon; but their refuſing to advance the good works of men into the room of Chriſt, and to aſſign unto them, what we are alone beholding to his Righteouſneſs for. On other accounts none plead the neceſſity of good works, nor preſs men to holineſs with greater earneſtneſs, and force of Scripture reaſon then they do, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105700:62"/> cannot but be known to all that are converſant in their Writings. And therefore publick ſatisfaction for this reproach caſt (not on particular perſons, but) on the whole Proteſtant intereſt, is juſtly expected from Mr. <hi>Collier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, foraſmuch as it appears that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the wholſome Doctrine of Orthodox Proteſtants, I will give him a taſte of what they teach concerning the neceſſity of Good works.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Synopſi purioris Theologiae,</hi> written by <hi>Polyander Rivet, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi> and <hi>Thyſius</hi> (no obſcure men amongſt the Proteſtants.) After they have in their 33 <hi>chap.</hi> laid down, and abundantly confirmed that truth concerning our Juſtification, which I have before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; in the <hi>34ch.</hi> they profeſſedly treat of our holineſs or Good works, which are the fruits of a lively and juſtifying Faith; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which they ſay §. 24.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Day of Judgement, and the Everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Am now come to the Chapters in Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> Book, wherein he treats of the day of Judgement, and the puniſhment of thoſe that then come into condemnation; concerning which his notions are ſo corrupt, and accommodate to give countenance to, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men in, a wicked courſe of life in this world, by ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, yea affirming that this notwithſtanding, there is hope for them in another world; That ſcarce any thing could have been written more oppoſite, and deſtructive to the Chriſtian Religion; and the main deſign of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I ſhall (according to my former method) briefly propoſe what the Scripture teacheth concerning this fundamental Article of the <hi>Eternal Judgement;</hi> and then remove out of the way what he hath oppoſed thereto. The Scripture teacheth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there ſhall moſt certainly be a ſolemn and ſet day; or time of Judgement, in which God will judge the world in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Act. 17. 31. Rom. 14. 10. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All perſons of high and low degree, good and bad, muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105700:63"/> before his Judgement-ſeat, and receive their ſentence from him, <hi>Mat. 25. 32. &amp;c. 1 Pet. 4. 5. Rev.</hi> 20. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All the actions, words and thoughts of men in this world, (though now never ſo ſecret) muſt then be brought to light, and accounted for, <hi>Prov. 24. 12. Eccleſ. 12. ult. Mat. 12. 36, 37. Rom. 2 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sentence ſhall be paſt upon all according as their works ſhall be found to have been, and every man ſhall receive what he hath done in the body, according to what he hath done whether it be good or bad. As is abundantly proved by the Texts cited before. But yet</p>
            <p>The works of the Saints, and the works of the wicked, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a different conſideration in this day: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The works of the Godly are not conſidered as meritorious of Heaven, which is aſſigned to them for an Everlaſting Inheritance by the ſentence of the great judge: <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. but only as the fruits and evidence of a true and lively Faith in Chriſt, unto which Salvation is promiſed for the ſake of his merit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The works of the reprobate world are directly conſidered, as deſerving in their own nature the puniſhment to be inflicted on them, and they are accordingly proceeded againſt, <hi>Rom. 6. ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all nations are divided into two Companies: The Sheep are ſet on the right hand of Chriſt, and the Goats on his left; The firſt are ſentenced to Eternal Life, and the other to Everlaſting wrath; and accordingly theſe ſhall go away into <hi>Everlaſting</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but the Righteous into Life Eternal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> begins to diſcourſe of this matter in the <hi>5th. Chapter</hi> of his Book: ſome things dropt therein, have been already anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore I ſhall only ſtay to mind the Reader, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scripture ſpeaks of different degrees of the puniſhment of ſinners, according to the different meaſures of Iniquity which they have filled up; yet it every where aſſures us that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all ſinners that are found without an intereſt in Chriſt, at the day of Judgement, ſhall be <hi>Everlaſting;</hi> as ſhall more fully be evinced in my reply to his next Chapter. And whereas he here ſpeaks ſomething of the condemnation of thoſe that ſinned againſt the Law, and never had the Goſpel tendred to them, either before or ſince Chriſt came in the fleſh; it is very doubtful to me, whether he honeſtly ſpeak out his mind in this matter, ſeeing he hath ſo ſtiffly maintained before, <hi>That the penalty of the breach of the firſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105700:63"/> Covenant was only temporal death; and that damnation is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Goſpel-diſobedience only; which they cannot be guilty of, which never heard the Goſpel.</hi> If this be true, I am ſure ſuch muſt not now come into condemnation. But whatever Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> will, or will not allow, we are ſure of the truth of the Scripture, which teacheth other Doctrine, as hath been already proved againſt him; which if he will ſubſcribe to, he muſt of neceſſity recede from this corrupt notion.</p>
            <p>We are now come to his <hi>7th. Chapter,</hi> p. 47. where he firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this enquiry,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether there may be any probability from Scripture light, of any deliverance from, or mitigation of the puniſhment of any, after the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is paſt, and the Judgement executed.</hi> Which he thus anſwers,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching this I do apprehend that there are probable grounds both from Scripture and Reaſon, that there may be a deliverance of ſome from the poenal part, or pains inflicted, though not from the ſenſe of loſs; the Judgement in that reſpect will be Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although it be exceeding ſinful for a man, though with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt pretence of modeſty, to ſuggeſt that which is oppoſite to a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion, and on that account Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> pretext of propoſing his notion on <hi>probable grounds,</hi> will not excuſe him; yet beſides this, you ſhall find him to be moſt poſitive, and peremptory in his aſſertion of what he here pretends to lay down only as a <hi>probable ſuppoſition;</hi> and that in the very next Sections; which is a full evidence that this pretended modeſty of his, ſerves only for a bait to the hook, which is by him let down to take ſimple Souls; which renders his deſign ſo much the worſe, and the more blame worthy.</p>
            <p>The ſufferings of the damned, have by the School-men (not improperly) been diſtinguiſhed, <hi>in poenam ſenſus, &amp; poenam damni; into the puniſhment of ſenſe, and puniſhment of loſs,</hi> the one is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in thoſe Texts that ſpeak of their being <hi>ſhut out from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> and the like; the other of thoſe that ſpeak of their being <hi>caſt into a Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, their being tormented day and night,</hi> &amp;c. But that there is any part of their puniſhment which is not <hi>poenal;</hi> and that this puniſhment of loſs, is to be diſtinguiſhed from that which is ſo; is ſuch a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as I think is peculiar to Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> who hath here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us with this diſtinction. Thus we may ſee, <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the words of his mouth is fooliſhneſs; and the end of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105700:64"/> his talk is (like to prove) miſchievous madneſs,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 13.</p>
            <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſuppoſeth the duration of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loſs, who are damned, ſhall be Eternal, but not that of ſenſe; he is utterly without any probable ground in Scripture or right reaſon for his Opinion; For although their ſuffering be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſt negatively, and ſometimes poſitively, yet there is no intimation of the ſeparating of the poſitive part from the negative, ſo that ſome perſons ſhall Eternally be puniſhed with the loſs of good, but not with the feeling of Evil; But both are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of their puniſhment, or (as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> terms it) their <hi>pain inflicted</hi> ſhall be Eternal, the Scripture is expreſs, which ſaith more then once, That they ſhall <hi>go into Hell, into the Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Let us now ſee what countenance Mr. <hi>C.</hi> gives to his notion; His firſt plea is;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture lets us know that ſome ſhall be ſaved, that through their own miſcarriages, ſhall looſe the reward of their own work,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 14, 15. They ſhall be ſaved yet ſo as by fire; <hi>and what that fire is, and how far it ſhall extend, at and after the Judgement, I muſt leave to him that knoweth all things, to determine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Text is by the Papiſts abuſively applyed to their Purgatory, and it muſt be acknowledged their reaſoning from it, hath as much <hi>probability</hi> as Mr. <hi>Colliers,</hi> though both they and he do miſerably wreſt it. He confeſſeth that he neither knows <hi>what this fire is, nor how far it ſhall extend.</hi> He may well excuſe us therefore, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take this, for any proof of his notion. That the fire here mentioned, is not to be taken properly, but metaphorically, is evident from the Apoſtles diſcourſe, which is wholly in terms uſed figuratively, <hi>viz. Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</hi> to ſignifie ſuch works as will not abide trial; <hi>Gold, Silver and precious Stones,</hi> to denote thoſe that will. So by fire, we are to underſtand, ſuch a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens works, as will be like fire unto the <hi>Gold, Stubble,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105700:64"/> burning up the one, and manifeſting the excellency of the other. And ſeeing Mr. <hi>C.</hi> in his following lines (though without giving any ſufficient reaſon therefore) doth reject the interpretation of thoſe, that refer this to any time or trial before the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I will not contend with him thereabout; but granting its reſpect to that time, conſider what muſt then be the true meaning of the Text; which can be extended no farther, then to ſignifie to us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the great day every mans work ſhall be ſtrictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and proved of what ſort it is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe works which have not been wrought in God, all labours beſtowed in a wrong way of Doctrine or practice, will then be burnt up, and prove unprofitable to thoſe that have wrought them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is poſſible that ſome who are themſelves built, and do build on the true foundation, may yet ſo far err in their work, at leaſt ſome part of it, as that it may not be approved in this day, but muſt be loſt, even as Wood, Hay, and Stubble is conſumed by the Fire; and they miſs of that reward which ſhall be given to thoſe, whoſe labour hath been better imployed, in the promoting of ſound Doctrine and Godlineſs, to the glory of God, and the profit of their own and others Souls. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this notwithſtanding, thoſe that have an intereſt in Chriſt, and have been in the main ſincere with God, ſhall <hi>themſelves be ſaved; yet ſo as by fire,</hi> they cannot eſcape this tryal of their work, and loſs of that ſuperadded gracious reward, which they ſhould have received, if they had built upon the foundation Gold, Silver, and precious Stones. Now let the whole context be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently read and weighed by his Reader and mine, and I doubt not but he will ſee that this Scripture proves not at all the Salvation of any that dye in their ſins, after the final ſentence is paſt upon them.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be unſeaſonable to remind Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> of thoſe rules of interpreting Scripture, that he would ſeem to have ſome regard to p. 39. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to underſtand any dark Scripture contrary to the plain revealed will of God in his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not to underſtand any Scripture ſo as to contradict others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo as to contradict the Volume of the Book of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This himſelf confeſſeth muſt needs be corrupt and dangerous, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105700:65"/> yet every one may ſee that his buſineſs throughout this Chapter is to oppoſe ſome few ſayings of Scripture, that have ſome difficulty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their interpretation, with parabolical and figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, corrupted by his falſe gloſſes, unto a multitude of plain Texts, and the whole ſcope of the Scripture bearing plentiful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the certainty of the <hi>Everlaſting</hi> puniſhment of the ungodly.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall proceed. He ſaith again;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord of all lets us to know that none ſhall be Eternally damned, but thoſe who ſin againſt the holy ſpirit;</hi> Mat. 12. 31. <hi>Three of the Evangeliſts ſtate this for confirmation,</hi> Mar. 3. 28.

                  </gap>ance from the Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now is Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> mask of pretended modeſty put off, and laid aſide; and inſtead thereof a daring aſſertion of his Hereſie is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and that by him boldly intitled to <hi>the Lord of all,</hi> which oweth its Original to the Father of lies, <hi>viz. That none ſhall be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally damned, but thoſe who ſin againſt the holy ſpirit</hi> and that he may at once give full proof of his confidence, he adds, that this is ſtated by three of the Evangeliſts; whereas in truth there is no ſuch thing, ſo much as intimated in any one of them; But in divers Texts of Scripture, the Lord of all lets us know, that many ſhall be Eternally damned for other ſins, that may not be chargeable with the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt: unto thoſe already pleaded, you may add <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 15. &amp; 21. 8.</p>
            <p>As for the Texts abuſed by him; The ſcope and deſign of them plainly; is to let the malicious revilers of Chriſt and his Miracles know; That although the Grace of God to ſinners is ſo abundant, that all ſin and blaſphemy, of thoſe that truly repent and believe in Chriſt may be, and to ſome hath been and ſhall be forgiven on the terms aforeſaid; yet thoſe that willingly and maliciouſly reject and blaſpheme Chriſt, ſo doing deſpight to the ſpirit of Grace, whereby they have been ſo far enlightened as to know, that what the Goſpel reveals concerning Chriſt and ſalvation by him is truth, are utterly excluded from hopes of pardon, or poſſibi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it being impoſſible to renew them to Repentance, and there remaining no more ſacrifice for ſin. Compare the Texts cited with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. The words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. are,</p>
            <p>v. 31. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you; All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men; but the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The ſame thing is intended in either of theſe Verſes, though the expreſſion thereof be doubled for the greater certainty, and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kableneſs thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you,</hi> This refers to what is before recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>v. 24. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>—<hi>all manner of ſin and blaſphemy,</hi> i. e. ſin and blaſphemy of every kind; not every individual ſin and blaſphemy: The adultery of Repenting <hi>David</hi> was forgiven, but not the adultery of thoſe mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. The blaſphemy of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the words that he ſpake againſt the Son of man, but not of <hi>Caiaphas, Herod,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>—<hi>ſhall be forgiven unto men:</hi> and ſo <hi>v. 32. it ſhall be forgiven him,</hi> i. e. it is remiſſible; By the grace of God through Faith in Chriſt, it may be forgiven, and to ſome it hath and ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. Verbs that ſignifie action, are ſometimes underſtood only of a faculty or power of action; ſo <hi>Pſal. 22. 18. I may tell all my bones:</hi> in the Hebrew it is, <hi>I will tell all my bones.</hi> The ſenſe is well expreſt in our tranſlation: and Prov. 20. 9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean,</hi> &amp;c. In the Hebrew it is, <hi>who ſaith.</hi> Many will ſay and pretend this; but the meaning is, who of right can ſay ſo. And that the words ſhould here be taken in this ſenſe, the analogy of Faith doth require.</p>
               <p>—<hi>but the blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt;</hi> or <hi>whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> i. e. whoſoever blaſphemeth wittingly and maliciouſly, againſt the inward enlightening, and conviction of the Spirit;</p>
               <p>—<hi>ſhall not be forgiven unto men:</hi> and v. 32, <hi>it ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him neither in this world, neither in that which is to come.</hi> Thus you have the certainty of their damnation firſt abſolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, <hi>v.</hi> 31. and then emphatically repeated in ſuch terms as may ſerve farther to cut them off from all hopes, and exclude all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of their forgiveneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 32. And in them no more is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then was before expreſt; and is in like abſolute terms expreſt by the other Evangeliſts: no intimation (which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines p. 48.) that any which are not forgiven in this world, may obtain pardon in that which is to come.</p>
            </q>
            <p>It is certain that it was a familiar phraſe with the <hi>Jews</hi> to call the age of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> the world to come; and ſome with great
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105700:66"/> probability to accept this ſenſe both here, and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. &amp; 6. 5. which if admitted, gives this interpretation of the place; That although by Chriſt believers are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet in the Goſpel is there no remedy provided for them that ſin againſt the holy ſpirit, but that tranſgreſſion remains unpardonable, both under the Law and under the Goſpel. Nay moreover, if we allow Mr. <hi>C.</hi> that forgiveneſs in the world to come is in theſe words in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>imated; yet neither will this relieve him; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the blotting out of the ſins of Believers at the coming of Chriſt; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that then the ſentence by which they are now abſolved will be publiſhed before men and Angels, and they poſſeſſed of the utmoſt advantages accruing to them by their pardon; ſo then declaratively they are forgiven in another world; But none have or can have an intereſt in this forgiveneſs, but thoſe that have repented and been converted in this world, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19, 20</p>
            <p>Indeed if we allow Mr. <hi>C.</hi> this notion, That ſinners ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given after they are damned; we muſt grant him more then what he yet openly pleads for, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhall not only be delivered from the poſitive part of their puniſhment, but the negative alſo: For he whoſe ſins are forgiven is a bleſſed man, and certainly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the favour of God. But it is in vain to expect that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo oppoſite to truth as Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> are, ſhould be brought to any conſiſtency.</p>
            <p>In p. 48. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> forms and anſwers this Objection,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Scripture only ſuppoſeth that on repentance, all ſuch ſins may be forgiven; not that they ſhall be forgiven without repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his anſwer hereunto he grants,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That we may not ſuppoſe the forgiveneſs of ſin firſt or laſt to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems then that the forgiveneſs in another work, which Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> dreams of, is attainable on the ſame terms on which it is offered in this, and no other; which is not only repentance, but alſo faith in the Lord Jeſus. So that according to his principles, after the Judgement is paſt, ſinners are ſtill upon the ſame terms with God as they are now in the day of his patience; Then which ſuppoſition, nothing can be more falſe, and repugnan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Now is the accepted time; now is the day of Salvation;</hi> And if poor ſinners do not <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near,</hi> Iſa. 55. 6. it will be too late in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

When death hath once turned us off the ſtage of this world, our day is paſt, and the night is come <hi>wherein no man can work,</hi> Joh. 9. 4. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. There will be no more <hi>repentance</hi> unto life then, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of changing our ſtate, but every man muſt Eternally reap the fruit of what he hath ſown in this life. And as there is no promiſe for the damned to hope in, or Goſpel to be preached to them, ſo neither ſhall they have any more a call to repentance, or tender of mercy for ever.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that there may be forgiveneſs, and acceptance after death, ſeems farther to appear: elſe what means</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 19, 20. <hi>with</hi> chap. 4. 6. <hi>In</hi> chap. 3. 19, 20. <hi>its ſaid,</hi> By which alſo he went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon, which ſometimes were diſobedient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>C.</hi> repeats the words, but omits the reſt, which are, <hi>when once the long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing: wherein few, that is, eight Souls were ſaved by Water.</hi> Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is here quite ſtarted from the thing in Queſtion, viz. <hi>Whether the damned may be releaſed from their torment, after the day of Judgement;</hi> and inſtead of proving that, talks of forgiveneſs <hi>after death</hi> before that day come, which is ſhort of the task under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by him, though as contrary to the whole tenour of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The meaning of the words wreſted by him (ſo far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the buſineſs in hand) is, That Chriſt by his ſpirit in <hi>Noah,</hi> (for thereby were the Prophets of old acted, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.) who was <hi>a preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 5. went and preached to the old world, whoſe ſpirits, for their diſobedience, were now in priſon reſerved to the Judgement of the great day. But againſt this, two things are objected by Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is ſaid he went,</hi> i. e. <hi>Chriſt, not his ſpirit only by</hi> Noah.</p>
            <p>The Text ſaith indeed <hi>He went,</hi> but fully explains alſo the <hi>manner how he went,</hi> viz. <hi>by his ſpirit;</hi> as God is frequently ſaid to ſpeak to thoſe, unto whom he ſent his Prophets, ſo is Chriſt here ſaid to preach to the old world, by his ſpirit in <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He does not ſay he went by</hi> Noah <hi>to the people of the old world, but he went and preached to the ſpirits (not perſons) in priſon:</hi> Noahs <hi>preaching was to perſons living, this to the ſpirits in priſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former part of this Objection is anſwered already, and the ſcope of the Text doth inforce the ſenſe I have given of it; and whereas Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith this preaching was <hi>to the ſpirits, not perſons in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105700:67"/> priſon,</hi> &amp;c. it is a meer quibble; for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them according to their preſent condition when he wrote this: He doth not ſay they were ſpirits in priſon when preached to; but that the ſpirits of <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105700:67"/> not be amiſs to make a little farther enquiry into the meaning of this Text. It is evident from the context, that the deſign of the Apoſtle is to preſs thoſe to whom he wrote unto ſanctification, and conformity to Chriſt, which doth conſiſt in their dying unto ſin, and living unto God, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. And in <hi>v.</hi> 4. he meets with an Objection, by which they might be retarded in their courſe of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>viz.</hi> That if they did not conform to the world, they muſt expect to become their gazing ſtock, and to ſuffer hard things from them; which he fortifies them againſt, by remembring them of the day of Judgement, in which ungodly ſinners muſt be accountable for all thoſe wrongs which the godly have received from them, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and this judgement is illuſtrated by a diſtribution of the object, <hi>the quick and the dead;</hi> and from the occaſion of this diſtribution the Apoſtle urgeth another argument againſt that diſcouragement which might ariſe from perſecution; Becauſe it had been the lot of others unto whom the Goſpel had been preached afore-time, and they had yielded obedience to it, <hi>to be judged according to men in the fleſh;</hi> i. e. to be cenſured and condemned according as the malice of men did dictate to them, in this world, which they did patiently bear, and through much tribulation did enter into the Kingdom of God, the great deſign of the Goſpel being accompliſhed upon them, in their <hi>living according to God,</hi> in a conformity to him and his will, <hi>in the ſpirit;</hi> i. e. in the exerciſe of grace and holineſs, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105700:68"/> which divers of great worth, have alſo embraced before me. But to return; Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> ſtill pleads for his corrupt ſenſe of the firſt words of the Text.</p>

               <hi>That its apparent from theſe expreſſions; 1. It was preached to them that are dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein the evidence of this expreſſion lies, Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> doth not declare; we read in <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. 8. of <hi>Naomi</hi> her Daughters in Law, <hi>dealing kindly with the dead,</hi> i. e. with their Husbands who were dead when <hi>Naomi</hi> ſpake this, but certainly their dealing kindly with them, was <hi>while living;</hi> and in the Verſe before this, is mention made of the Judgement of <hi>quick and dead:</hi> ſhall we hence conclude, that any ſhall <hi>remain dead</hi> in the day of Judgement.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That they might be judged according to (or as) men in the fleſh,</hi> viz. <hi>that they were judged, in this matter, as if they had been alive in the fleſh, which imports they were not.</hi>

What follows in this Section needs no farther reply, but is fully anſwered in what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written.</p>
            <p>The next ground urged by him p. 49. is as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture preſents us with the deliverance of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah <hi>in ſome time, from the greatneſs of their judgement; and of</hi> Samaria, <hi>Ez. 16. 46. &amp; 49. he promiſeth a reſtauration to them both, out of their forlorn eſtate,</hi> v. 55. 61. <hi>This is ſpoken of literal</hi> Sodom, <hi>and cannot be myſtically applyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two things ſuppoſed by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> without any proof offered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in this Scripture <hi>literal</hi> Sodom <hi>is ſpoken of,</hi> &amp;c. But if we take the words as they are read in our tranſlation, I conceive he can give no reaſon why they ſhould be applyed to literal <hi>Sodom,</hi> more then for the underſtanding of the promiſe <hi>literally,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall return to their former eſtate,</hi> which none ſhall do in this world, after death; much leſs after the day of Judgement.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:105700:68"/>2. He ſuppoſeth that the promiſe of reſtauration made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be applyed to thoſe particular perſons that periſhed under the ſtroke of Gods wrath; then which nothing is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; For the bulk of the people then in being, were threatned <hi>with utter deſtruction,</hi> and there was but a remnant that ſhould eſcape, which God would ſtill own, and make good theſe promiſes to. Indeed ſome paſſages in the cloſe of this Chapter may moſt properly be referred to Goſpel times; and were never intended, as promiſes to all the Seed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the fleſh (as the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues at large in the <hi>Romans</hi>) but to the Church, the ſpiritual Seed; although the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall have a large ſhare in them, when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired day of their calling, and returning to God is come; but their claim of right in new covenant bleſſings, muſt now be on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Faith in Chriſt, not their natural deſcent from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now look into the Text: and firſt we find, that when the Prophet enters upon this compariſon of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> v. 44. he ſaith, <hi>Every one that uſeth Proverbs, ſhall uſe this Proverb againſt thee,</hi> &amp;c. which doth plainly lead us to a metaphorical ſenſe of divers terms uſed in this proverbial, or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical diſcourſe. Yea he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 45. to the Jews, <hi>your Mother was an Hittite, and your Father an Amorite:</hi> which certainly is not to be taken in a ſtrict literal ſenſe, but is rather intended to note their corrupt manners then their natural deſcent. And ſo although in the name <hi>Sodom</hi> there is an alluſion to literal <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the puniſhment thereof, yet may we rather underſtand the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> to be intended, who were like to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in their ſinfulneſs, and in their puniſhment. See <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2 9. And there ſeems to be ſome farther occaſion of this alluſion, not only in the ſituation of theſe Countries near to the Land where <hi>Sodom</hi> ſtood, but more in that they ſprang from <hi>Lot,</hi> who was once an Inhabitant among the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> whoſe evil manners his poſterity did now conform to. And indeed we find this in Scripture to be a common brand of Great ſinners: See <hi>Job 36. 14. Iſa. 1. 10. Rev.</hi> 7. 8. Now many of theſe two Nations did return to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as divers of the ten Tribes did alſo, when <hi>Judah</hi> returned; but eſpecially are theſe promiſes made good in Goſpel times, in the gathering of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> into one Church, under one head Chriſt Jeſus. And theſe things duly weighed, lead to ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of this prophecy, as is according to the analogy of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105700:69"/> Faith, and fully agreeing with other Texts, both which are croſſed and contradicted, together with the whole ſcope of the Text under conſideration by the ſenſe that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would force upon it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is evident that the promiſes here made muſt have their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in this world, which is the only time and place for godly repentance, and entring into Covenant with God by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture and Reaſon doth cut off all hope of the retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (ſo much as) of any remnant of literal <hi>Sodom;</hi> ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 9. and ſaith expreſly, that the <hi>Sodomites</hi> do <hi>ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Jud. 7. which paſſage Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> mentions a little after, I ſuppoſe to prevent others objecting it againſt him, for certainly he cannot be ſo ignorant as to think that it ſtrengthens his ſenſe: no doubt thoſe that ſuffer the vengeance of <hi>Eternal fire,</hi> are cut off from all hope of deliverance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Grace promiſed in <hi>v.</hi> 62, 63. is not a deliverance from torment only; but a full and free pardon, and taking of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons pardoned into Covenant with God, which includes their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him as their portion, which, by Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> own grant, is no ways applicable to the damned in Hell.</p>
            <p>And it is evident that the <hi>tollerableneſs</hi> allowed unto <hi>Sodom</hi> in the day of Judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. (which he pleads) is only comparative; they ſhall be tormented leſs then thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Goſpel. And the reaſoning of our Saviour in that, and like Texts, is to this purpoſe, <hi>That the condemnation of the</hi> Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites <hi>will be great, is eaſily granted by you, becauſe they were great ſinners; and you are promiſing to your ſelves a far better portion then theirs is like to be in the day of Judgement; but do not deceive your ſelves, for your ſin in rejecting the Goſpel, is greater then any they were guilty of, and your puniſhment (if you go on to neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) will be heavier then theirs; It ſhall be more tolerable for them in the day of Judgement then for you.</hi> And there is no force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or terrour to the perſons threatned, ſuitable to what is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if according to Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notion, p. 53. <hi>The day of general Judgement ſhould be the day of</hi> Sodoms <hi>eaſe.</hi> That they ſhould not be then condemned, but releaſed from their puniſhment, and eſcape the Judgement that the reſt of the wicked world fall under. If this aſſertion of his be not bold and antiſcriptural, I know not what deſerves to be ſo accounted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> proceeds to argue,</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:105700:69"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Why may we not ſuppoſe that God may in time be pacified towards ſinners, after they have born their ſin and judgement, as formerly he hath declared himſelf to be, or will be in time to come,</hi> Ez. 16. 58.—<hi>Seeing God hath been or will be pacified in Judgement, why ſhould we ſuppoſe him to be unreconcileable, and never to be pacified in this laſt and great Judgement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there indeed no difference betwixt the ſtate of men in <hi>time,</hi> and in <hi>Eternity?</hi> why then can Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſee no reaſon againſt ſinners expectation of the ſame mercy hereafter, as now ſome do partake of in the pardon of their ſins, and ſalvation by Chriſt? Men are now under a <hi>mixt diſpenſation</hi> of juſtice and mercy, and the time of life in this world is the only time of Gods patience, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. and while this time doth laſt, he doth as well deſign the reclaiming of ſinners by <hi>temporal Judgements,</hi> as the vindicating of his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and therefore when this is accompliſhed, he may be here, and oft-times is <hi>pacified</hi> towards ſinners. But in the world to come this mixt diſpenſation ceaſeth, and the Veſſels of mercy ſhall enjoy the fruit of mercy perfectly and only; and the veſſels of wrath the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of juſtice, all that is then deſigned towards them, being the <hi>making known of wrath,</hi> and <hi>glorifying juſtice</hi> upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. They muſt drink the Wine of Gods <hi>wrath without mixture,</hi> Rev. 14. 10. And therefore no hope for them after this <hi>laſt and great Judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeds; <hi>The Scripture ſaith expreſly, That God is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of thoſe that believe; and it is not preſent outward ſalvation that the Apoſtle is there ſpeaking of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Text referred to, is 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. where the Apoſtle is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an account of his diligence, and conſtancy in the work of the Miniſtry, notwithſtanding the perſecutions that did or might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him on that account, as alſo the encouragement he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; becauſe <hi>he truſted in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe;</hi> which can intend no other then the conſerving providence of God, which is over all, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his own people: So the 70 render <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 6. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>Thou wilt ſave</hi> (or <hi>preſerve) Men and Beaſts O Lord.</hi> It is evident the Apoſtle encourageth himſelf in that ſalvation that is preſently enjoyed in this world, <hi>who is the Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. and if Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> corrupt ſenſe of this Text be admitted, I cannot ſee how he will exclude thoſe that have ſinned againſt the holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ghoſt, otherwiſe then by an arbitrary exception of his own; for <hi>every man</hi> is partaker of the ſalvation here intended.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105700:70"/>
            <p>In the 7 §. p. 50. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> repeats again who it is for whom he intends this deliverance from Hell-torments; But with his vain words we are not concerned, being well aſſured, There is no ſuch thing: and that diſtinction inſiſted on §. 8. we have already proved to be vain and groundleſs; Thoſe that are under the Eternal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt ſuffer Eternal <hi>torment</hi> as well as <hi>loſs.</hi> And indeed (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this mans principles) they may as well expect delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the one as from the other; for thoſe that have forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, have alſo Righteouſneſs imputed to them; and are on that account received to glory, not for their own good works; the want of which he makes the only bar unto the admiſſion of theſe perſons into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Yea he aſſerts farther §. 9. <hi>That this favour and mercy ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them on the account, and for the ſake of Chriſt;</hi> and again, p. 54.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why we ſhould make that an argument againſt all Grace after the Judgement (the infinite Sacrifice remaining the ſame to have its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence herein) which hath been our alone hope and help before the Judgement: -.- I do not yet underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is pleaded that ſin is againſt an infinite Majeſty, and therefore deſerveth Everlaſting puniſhment; and this Mr. <hi>C.</hi> acknowledgeth to be true; but yet ſaith, that God is infinite in Grace as well as in Juſtice, and therefore this property of God can be no bar to the relief of the damned; and then pleads, <hi>That the infinite ſacrifice of Chriſt remains the ſame to have its influence for the obtaining of Grace after the Judgement as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be ſo, either Heaven was never purchaſed by Chriſt for thoſe that believe in this world, or the damned have through the influence of his ſacrifice, as free acceſs thither, upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as we. Nay, if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> will ſuſpend it on mens good works, ſeeing they may repent when damned, why may they not do other good works alſo to ſuch a meaſure as to earn Heaven as well as we?</p>
            <p>But behold here another inſtance of his daring confidence in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting his antiſcriptural and pernicious notions! where is the Scripture that ſaith Chriſt died for the Redemption of the damned in Hell? or that his Sacrifice was ever deſigned for the obtaining of Grace for ſuch as die in their ſins? It is moſt certain, that when the great day of Judgement is paſt, the Lord Chriſt hath finiſhed all his work as Mediator, and will then preſent his Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105700:70"/> before God, and ſo give up the Kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. &amp;c. There will therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no more ſacrifice for ſins pleadable for the remiſſion of any that are not already ſaved, but their Redemption <hi>ceaſeth for ever.</hi> And although ſinners in the day of Gods patience, are invited and encouraged to come to him on the account of his infinite mercy in Chriſt; yet is it no where propoſed as a ground for hope, or ſpring of comfort to the damned, who are the objects not of mercy, but divine vengeance.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he pleads;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this is rational and moſt God-like, who hath let us know that he will ſuit his Judgements, to mens various facts for meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is moſt rational and becoming God, which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his word, and it is the higheſt preſumption to dictate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him another way, for the manifeſtation of his glory upon the veſſels of wrath, then himſelf hath fixed on. <hi>Who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Himſelf alſo hath revealed, That as a righteous Judge he will ſuit his Judgements to the various facts of men, and that ſome <hi>ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes, others with few,</hi> Luk. 12. 47, 48.

            <p>That we have any <hi>hint</hi> in the Scripture of <hi>limitation,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>time of the puniſhment of the wicked,</hi> is falſe. And that <hi>reaſon and righteouſneſs</hi> do render ſuch a limitation neceſſary, is audacious boldneſs to aſſert: <hi>Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?</hi> ſhall vile duſt be ſo bold, as to fix the demerit, and limit the puniſhment of an offence againſt the infinite <hi>Jehovah!</hi> But <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 59. is brought in to give countenance to this abomination: the words are, <hi>I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt not depart thence untill <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. It moſt emphatically ſets forth their irrecoverable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting damnation; for if they may not expect any mercy, but muſt themſelves pay the utmoſt mite they are indebted to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 35. And this is directly the ſcope of the parable, to take men off from their preſumptions of relief in another world, and to preſs them now to make their calling and Election ſure. And if it may be thought that men may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie divine Juſtice, and pay the laſt mite, I know not out the Devils may poſſibly do ſo too; and may as well as men, on this account, juſtly claim a releaſe from their torments, ſooner or later.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have confidered and removed what Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> offers for the countenancing of his new Doctrine; and by reaſon of my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already exceeded the room I intended to have comprized this reply in, I ſhall be forced only to touch upon divers things that are behind in his Book; The next work which (all in vain) he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth himſelf to; is an endeavour to obviate thoſe Objections that may be made againſt his notion of the Judgement, ſome of which have already been inforced, and his cavils anſwered; others of them are laid ſo ſlightly, (I ſuppoſe) that he might make ſome ſhew of anſwering ſomething, as ſcarce any body beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would have ſo expreſt their mind; and with theſe I ſhall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concern my ſelf; only the ſecond muſt be inſiſted on when we come to it.</p>
            <p>The firſt Objection Mr. <hi>C.</hi> takes notice of; is that which he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth may ariſe from thoſe Texts that affirm, <hi>but few ſhall be ſaved, Mat. 7. 14. Luk.</hi> 13. 24.</p>
            <p>It is certain that more may be collected from ſuch ſayings, then ever he is able to remove out of his way; For if there be but two
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105700:71"/> ſorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>little flock</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>his Church</hi> which ſhall be ſaved; and <hi>the Goats,</hi> the <hi>world of ungodly</hi> which ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then may we in no wiſe admit (what he hath before afferted) <hi>that multitudes ſhall be ſaved, that are not eſpouſed to Chriſt;</hi> or, <hi>That none ſhall be Eternally damned but thoſe that ſin againſt the holy ſpirit.</hi> Let us hear what he ſaith to theſe things.</p>
            <p>Firſt he grants, <hi>That few enter in at the ſtraight gate,</hi> &amp;c. but then adds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though ſluggiſh Chriſtians and Formaliſts enter not in at the ſtraight gate, yet this proves not that they ſhall find no mercy at all: if ſo, Wo will be the caſe of moſt of profeſsors at that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no middle way, if perſons enter not in at the ſtraight gate that leadeth to Eternal Life, they muſt go in at the wide gate that leadeth to deſtruction; and if their names are not found in the Book of Life, they muſt be caſt into the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, where they are tormented forever and ever. Yea but if there be not ſome proviſion made againſt this rigour; Formaliſts, yea the moſt of profeſſors will be in an ill caſe; and the fooliſh Virgins are not like to obtain ſo great a priviledge in this day as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath before allowed to them, And therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his opinion muſt be admitted. This in plain terms is no leſs then to accommodate his Doctrine to give countenance to the wickedneſs of men: <hi>Formaliſts</hi> are <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the midſt of their profeſſion, and they ſhall be ſo far from finding mercy in that day, that their caſe will prove worſt of all: ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. the laſt Verſe. And how many ſoever they be that are in that day found without the wedding garment of Faith and true Holineſs, they muſt (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may now truſt to lying words, and make much of the pillows that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſoweth under their Arm-holes) <hi>be caſt into outer darkneſs, where there is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 22. 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it will then be manifeſt to the Eternal woe of <hi>formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, That many are called but few are choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Objection is thus laid down by him, p. 51.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture ſentenceth the wicked with Eternal damnation, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us that it ſhall be Everlaſting,</hi> Mat. 25. 41, 46.</p>
            <p>This in my Judgement is utterly <hi>unanſwerable,</hi> unleſs Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> teſtimony prevail againſt that of the Scripture. That the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment of the wicked is plentifully aſſerted therein, is manifeſt; and a cogent proof hereof we have in the Text inſtanced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41, and 46.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> here and in other places) is uſed to expreſs the duration of both, and that in ſuch wiſe as can no more admit of limitation with reſpect to the one then with reſpect to the other; <hi>Everlaſting life,</hi> and <hi>Everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> being <hi>conſtantly</hi> and <hi>directly oppoſed</hi> to each other. We will now conſider Mr. <hi>C's</hi> anſwer: He ſaith,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Its evident that</hi> Mat. 25. <hi>intends profeſſing Chriſtian nations; for others cannot be accuſed and ſentenced for not ſhewing kindneſs to Chriſt in his Members,—and ſo may be ſuch as under the ſound of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſinned againſt the holy ſpirit, or ſuch as may obtain a time of mitigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That only profeſſing Chriſtian nations are intended in this Text, is utterly falſe, and againſt the expreſs terms thereof: <hi>Before him ſhall be gathered all Nations</hi> v. 32. Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Others cannot be accuſed for not ſhewing kindneſs to Chriſt in his Members:</hi> We grant it; But muſt they not therefore appear before his Judgement-ſeat? and may they not be accuſed and ſentenced for other ſins? Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> may as well infer from this Text, That profeſſing Nations ſhall be accuſed and ſentenced only for ſins of omiſſion, ſeeing no other are here mentioned, as that other Nations ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this ſentence; It was evident that Chriſts deſign was not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105700:73"/> to enumerate all the ſins, that men ſhall be condemned for, but only to give inſtance in ſome, which they to whom he then ſpake, were immediately concerned in. But if this were granted, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> he is ſtill in as bad caſe as before, for certainly thouſands that die in their ſins, even where the Goſpel is preached, are yet never guilty of the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt: To ſolve this he tells us, <hi>ſuch may obtain a time of mitigation;</hi> Although the Text ſay, That all which were ſet on the left hand of Chriſt, ſhall go away into <hi>Everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> Thus by contradicting the Text, he hath boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to cut the knot which he could not untye. He proceeds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eternal, Everlaſting and for ever, being underſtood according to the common uſe and import of the word in Scripture, ſeems rather to confirm this underſtanding then otherwiſe; for we muſt underſtand it according to the time or times intended, and not always for ever without end, but very often the contrary, and that both in the Old and New Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> could have ſaid nothing more againſt himſelf, then what he hath here written; for if theſe words are to be interpreted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>ſubject matter,</hi> (which he calls, <hi>the time or times intended</hi>) then certainly when they are referred to that ſtate which ſucceeds <hi>time,</hi> when <hi>duration</hi> ſhall be no more meaſured by days and months and years, but <hi>time,</hi> ſhall be ſwallowed up in <hi>Eternity,</hi> they can denote no leſs, then <hi>for ever without end.</hi> Moreover that theſe terms are moſt commonly uſed in this ſenſe, both in the Scripture and amongſt men, cannot be denyed: and when a thing is ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> we cannot on any account ſuppoſe it ſhall have an end, unleſs it be in one of theſe two caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the duration of that thing is expreſly limited to ſome time, in other Texts. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the ſubject to which any thing ſaid to be Eternal, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, is not capable of an abſolutely Eternal duration, at leaſt in that condition, wherein alone, this may be attributed to it.</p>
            <p>And thus it is, in all thoſe Texts where theſe terms are uſed in a limited ſenſe in the Scripture; as any one may clearly ſee, that ſhall read the places cited by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> or others like to them. Now this will in no wiſe warrant his reſtriction of them in the preſent caſe. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are (in reference to the puniſhment of the wicked) no where limited throughout the Book of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> himſelf confeſſeth, that wicked men ſhall remain in being for ever: So then here is an <hi>unlimited threatning</hi> of <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105700:74"/> puniſhment</hi> to be inflicted on a <hi>capable ſubject;</hi> and for any man to ſay that leſs is intended, is a blaſphemous contradiction to the Scriptures. Indeed the Eternity of the torment of wicked men, is expreſt by all thoſe phraſes in the word of God, that are moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant of a duration without end; ſo that nothing can be ſpoken more, then is therein contained for the clearing this matter.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> proceeds to inſtance in ſome Texts where <hi>for ever,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> are uſed in a limited ſenſe in the Old Teſtament; which limitation hath already been conſidered, and the reaſon of it fixed; But he ſeems to lay ſpecial weight on <hi>Jer. 7. 7. &amp; 25. 5. where</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>for ever and ever muſt be thus underſtood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the like reaſon for the limitation here, as in the other Texts, that ſpeak of <hi>ſerving for ever,</hi> and <hi>an everlaſting Prieſthood of</hi> Aaron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and till Mr. <hi>C.</hi> can produce evidence of the ſame reaſon, and neceſſity to admit a limitation with reſpect to the puniſhment of ſinners, he ſaith not one tittle to the purpoſe: In both theſe places the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are told, that on condition of their Obedience to God, they ſhould enjoy their Land, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which we render <hi>for ever and ever;</hi> the 70 exactly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: i. e. <hi>from age to age;</hi> or <hi>from generation to generation,</hi> as long as they and their off-ſpring remained in the world: But there is another phraſe uſed in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to ſignifie an <hi>abſolutely Eternal duration, viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which by the 70 is rendred very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and to expreſs the ſame thing are theſe words uſed oft in the New Teſtament; and are rendred <hi>for ever and ever:</hi> yea three times is the duration of the torment of the wicked expreſt by them therein; and that the phraſe might be more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical, they are put in the plural number, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ſignificancy of which we cannot reach in our Language: This you find <hi>Rev. 14. 11. &amp; 19. 3. &amp;</hi> 20. 10. And I am well aſſured neither Mr. <hi>C.</hi> nor any of his <hi>Socinian</hi> maſters, can produce one place in the New Teſtament; where theſe words in ſuch a connexion, may be taken in a limited ſenſe.</p>
            <p>To his diſcourſe concerning the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I ſhall briefly make this anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a word of many ſignifications, is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and therefore muſt be interpreted according to the ſcope of the place where it is uſed; although it cannot be denied but oft-times <hi>Eternity</hi> is ſignified thereby; as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 51. &amp; 58. (with divers other places) where it is uſed to expreſs the Eternal duration of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105700:74"/> life and bleſſedneſs of Believers; and in <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 29. The Everlaſting miſery of thoſe that have ſinned againſt the holy ſpirit, is expreſt thereby. And for Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to inſtance in thoſe Texts where it is not directly expreſſive of time; but the <hi>duration of things created in time;</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. or doth ſignifie the <hi>courſe of men in this world,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. to prove that it may be taken in a limited ſenſe, when it ſtrictly imports the duration of ſomething, in another world, when <hi>time ſhall be no more,</hi> is meer trifling. But he ſaith, <hi>not only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which are the common words for everlaſting, and for ever, yet muſt frequently be underſtood with limitation,</hi> &amp;c. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſometimes intends the time before the world was; ſometime the time of a mans life,</hi> Phil. v. 15.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will grant, that the uſe of this word, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. where it is to be conſidered <hi>a parte ante,</hi> is that wherein we are not concerned in our preſent diſquiſition: it is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him to prove, that when it is uſed to ſignifie <hi>duration (à parte poſt) yet to come,</hi> it is frequently to be taken in a limited ſenſe in the New Teſtament; and that it <hi>muſt be ſo taken</hi> when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate of the torments of the damned.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for ever;</hi> which we grant to be an hyperbolical expreſſion, denoting as long time as they lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the reaſon of this limitation is clear in the Text; He could not longer enjoy him as a Servant. A like ſaying to this we meet with in an Heathen Poet,</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Serviet aeternùm, qui parvo neſciet uti.</hi> Horat.</q>
            <p>Not one place more can be produced, where <hi>ſuch a limitation</hi> of the ſenſe of this word may be admitted; and yet it is uſed about 70 times in the New Teſtament. And therefore Mr. <hi>C.</hi> doth wofully prevaricate when he ſaith, <hi>it muſt frequently be thus underſtood.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the common uſe of it is ſuch, as (Mr. <hi>C.</hi> himſelf being Judge) will <hi>admit</hi> of no <hi>limitation:</hi> ſometimes it is put to ſignifie the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting being, glory</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> of <hi>God himſelf;</hi> and about 50 times or more, in the New Teſtament, is the <hi>eternal duration</hi> of the <hi>Saints life</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> in another world, expreſt thereby; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>everlaſting</hi> torments of the wicked is ſo alſo; as hath been before urged; and every one may ſee how prepoſterous a courſe it would be, becauſe the term is <hi>once uſed figuratively</hi> in a limited <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which the ſubject there treated of, and ſcope of the place doth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105700:75"/> inforce; therefore to limit it in all other places where it doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, although there be not only <hi>no reaſon for it,</hi> but alſo in the things ſpoken of, an utter repugnancy to ſuch a limitation. And if Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> know theſe things already, he is far from <hi>upright dealing</hi> in this buſineſs: if he know them not, he is guilty of great <hi>temerity</hi> in publiſhing ſuch things as theſe to the world at all adventures.</p>
            <p>Much more might be added, but I muſt haſten.</p>
            <p>In the laſt branch of his anſwer to this Objection, p. 52. he hath recourſe again to his former diſtinction, and allows the Judgement of the wicked to be Eternal in reſpect of their loſs: But the vanity of this, hath been already detected, and my anſwer thereto need not be here repeated.</p>
            <p>The next thing he attempts, is to clear his Doctrine f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n here for a ſeaſon, in which men wiſh for death, and cannot obtain it; what will be the dreadful ſtate of ſinners that muſt lye in the fiery Lake, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a 100. ſome a 1000. and ſome perhaps 10000 years,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus he will interpret <hi>Everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> to be lying in the fiery Lake <hi>perhaps an hundred years;</hi> yea according to his principles, perhaps it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not be an hundred days, no nor an hundred hours neither; for if they repent (which he ſuppoſeth they may and ſhall do) the ſacrifice of Chriſt remains the ſame to procure their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don then as now; and no doubt he will allow them the ſame power and free-will to repent there as here, ſo that as ſoon as they find the place diſpleaſing to them, they may repent, and repenting may obtain mercy, and deliverance out of it. And if this were true, there is nothing can be deviſed more effectual to encourage a wicked life; as on the contrary, The Doctrine of Eternal Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth make ſinners tremble: and by it they are reſtrained from much wickedneſs which otherwiſe they would ruſh into: See alſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> is aware alſo that ſome will tax him for complying with the Popiſh Doctrine concerning <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and therefore p. 53. he endeavours to ſhew the difference betwixt <hi>his Purgatory</hi> and theirs.</p>
            <p>I cannot now ſtay to run the paralel betwixt them; but muſt tell him in ſhort,</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:105700:75"/>
            <p>1. That although his Doctrine of a <hi>Purgatory after Judgement</hi> be not ſo pernicious to mens Purſes, as the Papiſts have rendred theirs, yet it is full as much, if not more ruining to their Souls that ſhall receive it, and they that follow either of theſe blind guids, and content themſelves to go out of this world without Faith and true Holineſs, on hopes of a time to repent and better their ſtate hereafter, will certainly fall into the ditch of Eternal woe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and their heavy curſe will (all too late for their own relief) come upon thoſe that ſeduced them with this <hi>vain hope,</hi> that will prove as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On two accounts, his Doctrine in this point is more groſs then the Papiſts; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They make believers, <hi>fideles</hi> (ſuppoſed to die in venial ſin) the ſubjects of their Purgatory; But Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will indulge the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> yea all that have not ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt, to paſs through his Purgatory unto <hi>forgiveneſs and eaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They place their Purgatory before the laſt Judgement and final ſentence; ſo that they do not ſo directly oppoſe that fundamental Article concerning the <hi>Eternal Judgement,</hi> as he doth; nor ſuppoſe any poſſibility of ſinners obtaining a change of their condition after the ſentence is paſt by the great Judge; which yet Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath the boldneſs to plead for.</p>
            <p>There are other unſavoury notions couched in his anſwer to this Objection, <hi>viz. That ordinarily ſinners do not come under</hi> any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>or ſuffer</hi> any puniſhment <hi>before the great day,</hi> &amp;c. But I muſt paſs over them at preſent; only mind how contrary this is to what we are taught in <hi>Luk. 16. 23. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 19. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The laſt Objection that I ſhall be concerned to take any notice of, is to this purpoſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the damnation of the wicked be limited unto time, why may not the ſalvation of the Godly be ſo likewiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although Mr. <hi>C.</hi> pretend that there is not the like reaſon for the one as for the other; this will not ſecure us of the poſſeſſion of this truth; For if his arguing were right, we had no word in Scripture that aſſures us of Eternal Glory; There being no term uſed therein to ſignifie the Everlaſting duration of the Saints happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but what is uſed to denote the duration of ſinners tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which Mr. <hi>C.</hi> will not allow to be without end: And as he hath to day pretended reaſons for limiting the words in this reſpect; ſo may another idle brain to morrow, deviſe as good reaſon

            <p>In Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> 8th. <hi>Ch.</hi> he pretends to give ſome reaſons of his underſtanding the Scriptures abuſed by him as he dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: But they being urged on thoſe falſe grounds, which have been already detected and refuted, I will not abuſe my Readers patience to attend my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or farther raking into ſuch an heap: But ſhall oppoſe thereto ſome reaſons, why his notion of the <hi>Judgement</hi> and puniſhment of ſinners muſt be rejected, briefly ſummed up from the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I ſhall begin with his own words, p. 1, 2.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>For any to affirm that which the Scripture doth not, muſt needs be unſound and unſafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Scripture no where affirms, nor allows, That perſons may obtain forgiveneſs after they are damned, and by Repentance get out of Hell-torments, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> aſſertion hereof (by his own confeſſion) muſt be eſteemed unſound and unſafe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That aſſertion, which is contrary to the expreſs terms, and evident ſcope of the holy Scriptures, in a fundamental Article; is pernicious and Heretical.</p>
            <p>But this Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> is ſuch; <hi>ergo;</hi> It is pernicious and Heretical; and if ſo, to be rejected by all that love truth, and tender the ſafeguard of their own Souls.</p>
            <p>The firſt propoſition I ſuppoſe will not be denyed, and the ſecond, is abundantly proved in the foregoing Lines; unto which you may add <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. where you read, that this truth concerning the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgement lies in the foundation of our Religion. And it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it is called the <hi>Eternal Judgement;</hi> becauſe the ſentence then pronounced is unalterable, and bindeth for ever: The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men is finally determined thereby, and they left under an impoſſibility of obtaining any change thereof (either in whole or part) to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Doctrine whereof the juſt and neceſſary conſequences, are abſurd and contradictory to Scripture, is ſo it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the Doctrine of Mr. <hi>C.</hi> concerning <hi>forgiveneſs after death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> I think cannot be oppoſed with any colour: it is a ſure maxime, <hi>Ex veris nil niſi verum.</hi> The juſt and neceſſary conſequence of a true notion, is truth, and nothing elſe.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:105700:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is in part proved before; and ſhall be now farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by an inſtance or two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Mr. <hi>Colliers</hi> notion be admitted, The day wherein we muſt all appear before the Judgement-ſeat of Chriſt, is not the <hi>laſt day,</hi> (though called ſo <hi>Joh. 12. 48. Jam.</hi> 5. 3.) nor can that be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>final Judgement:</hi> for he meaſures the damned ſinners endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of torments, by days and years after that; and allows no Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of them, but that which perhaps may expire in an hundred years; and then they experience a change in their releaſe from them, which <hi>releaſe</hi> cannot certainly be obtained without a <hi>ſecond ſentence</hi> of the Judge paſt concerning the perſons diſcharged; yea his notion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a <hi>viciſſitude of changes in infinitum,</hi> after that Judgement, which in Scripture Language is the <hi>laſt,</hi> hath paſt upon men. For if they are capable of repenting ſo as to obtain forgiveneſs, then by the ſame reaſon we may conclude a poſſibility of their ſinning again to condemnation, and ſo repenting again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which doth infer that men are in no fixed ſtate in another world; and alſo that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>ſentences</hi> may be paſt upon them (according as they change their manners) after the Judgement of the great day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Opinion ſuppoſeth <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> wherein proviſion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made for the relief of the damned; and doth contradict all thoſe Texts, that ſpeak of the preſent Goſpel miniſtration; as the only day of Gods gracious viſiting ſinners, and making tenders of mercy and forgiveneſs to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It lays a foundation not only of praying for <hi>the dead, but the damned alſo.</hi> If <hi>favour and mercy</hi> may be extended to them <hi>for the ſake of Chriſt,</hi> as he hath aſſerted, we have the ſame reaſon, and ſo the ſame warranty to pray for them; as is by the Apoſtle urged for our praying for all men while living in this world, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>But why do I detain my Reader with a particular account of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities that flow from this mans opinion, which yet he would have us think to be moſt rational? <hi>Dato uno-abſurdo, mille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>equentur.</hi> I will break off here, and leave others to collect thoſe that remain, in their own thoughts of theſe things, and ſpeedily put a period to theſe lines.</p>
            <p>To his <hi>9th. Ch.</hi> where he tells us what <hi>uſe</hi> he ſuppoſeth may be made of his Doctrine; I ſhall make no farther reply; but having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>unſound;</hi> I conclude that it muſt needs be not only <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> but alſo <hi>pernicious</hi> to the Souls of men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe all with one word, 1. To Profeſſors, 2. To open ſinners.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:105700:77"/>
            <p>Firſt, Unto thoſe that profeſs ſubjection to Chriſt, and are found walking in his ways, I make it may earneſt requeſt, and that not in my own but Chriſts name; That they labour after <hi>ſtedfaſtneſs</hi> in the faith and profeſſion of Gods truth, eſpecially in ſuch a day as this, wherein many ſpeak perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them: And in order hereunto, that they cry mightily to God to make their hearts ſound in his Statutes; and content not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a bare aſſent to truth, but receive it in the love thereof; that they may in their own Breaſts have that teſtimony to the power and efficacy thereof, which alone will ſecure their <hi>profeſſion,</hi> in an hour of temptation; and that they be careful as well to hold forth the Doctrine of Chriſt, by a life comformable thereto, as by confeſſing it with their tongues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To thoſe that live in their ſins, I would ſpeak in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Can your heart endure? or can your hands be ſtrong in the day wherein God will deal with you?</hi> Oh remember how fearful a thing it is to fall into the hands of the living (ſin reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging) God! who can dwell with devouring fire, with <hi>Everlaſting burnings?</hi> Be perſwaded therefore by them that know the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrours of the Lord, to ſeek him <hi>while he may be found,</hi> and to call upon him <hi>while he is near:</hi> oh what would the Chriſtleſs man give in exchange for his Soul, when he ſees there is <hi>no remedy,</hi> but he muſt have his part with the Devil and his Angels, in the fire that is not quenched! But Repentance, Intreaties, Tears, will obtain no pity, when once the <hi>door of Grace is ſhut;</hi> If Chriſt be not received, and the heart made obedient to his counſel in this world, the ſinner is loſt, and ſhall be rejected by the Lord for ever. Oh that word <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity!</hi> how full of dread is it to them that live and dye Children of wrath! and yet how few are there that now lay theſe things to heart? and are ſeriouſly concerned to <hi>fly from the wrath which is to come!</hi> One would think the thoughts of <hi>Eternal Judgement,</hi> ſhould make the boldeſt ſinner tremble, and ſhould turn the ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his iniquity into Gravel-Stones, and make that which he now drinks down like Water, to become as Gall and Wormwood to him: But alas! So wicked is the heart of Man, and deſperately bent on a ſinful courſe; that unleſs he be renewed by effectual Grace, no perſwaſion will prevail with him to forſake thoſe ways, which lead to that place of torment where there is weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore.</p>
